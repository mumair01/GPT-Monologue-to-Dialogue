962,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
963,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,as you mentioned<ts>  and it was just eye opening like i was like
964,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
965,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,so this is what skiing is like
966,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
967,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,i didn't
968,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
969,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,i like just realized that you guys have it so good
970,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah which is also another reason why i don't really feel the need to ski out here cause i'm just like

987,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
988,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,cause it takes like an hour to travel there
989,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,right right
990,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,but yeah it's so nice and i don't know makes me feel so small just cause all the mountains are so big

1051,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,it was either this or a six page research paper
1052,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,right yeah
1053,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,and i was not about that<ts>  so
1054,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,no i know some people who like didn't get their shit together until the last minute and then had to the write the research paper
1055,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,oh gosh
1056,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,luckily like you don't have to do it that well cause like<ts>  it's not graded it's like just completion but it's like
1057,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,they don't really yeah
1058,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,you have the page has to you know you have to write something
1059,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah you have to get words on there
1060,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1061,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah<ts>  for sure
1062,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,ugh<ts>  and it's just like so annoying so it's definitely good to be on top of it cause it'll sneak up on you and then at the of the semester like they'll all be full because everyone's freaking out trying to like fill their their hours
1063,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1064,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah how do you like intro psych
1065,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,it's good i really like the professors

1073,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,or i guess thought provoking but
1074,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1075,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,i think that's just because we're comparing her to the other two<ts>  like
1076,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,i don't know is it shin
1077,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,shin yeah she's the d department head i think

1085,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,okay
1086,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,this class i'm like not super hyped about but it's required for all i think i'm probably majoring in biopsych so i have to take it
1087,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,bio psych<ts>  okay
1088,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,and i should just like get it over with and take it next semester but
1089,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1090,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,really don't want to and it's like a internal struggle i've been having these past few days
1091,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1092,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,since classes come out
1093,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,is<ts>  this is just your second psych class that you're in now or your third

1096,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah so
1097,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,i was thinking majoring in it but i'm not not too sure yet
1098,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah i think<ts>  ugh i don't know it's hard to
1099,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,are you pre med
1100,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah

1180,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,chem like<ts>  oof
1181,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1182,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,um
1183,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,i've heard that it's tough
1184,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah i like<ts>  i'm still i'm very glad that i took it last year<ts>  partially cause it's like over
1185,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,just to get out of the way yeah
1186,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah but also it's it's pretty helpful for bio<ts>  it like
1187,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,that's true
1188,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,uh like the first unit i don't know like how much chem you did in high school but like a lot of that was chem and like chirality<ts>  and just like amino acid structure
1189,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,mm
1190,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,and like electro negativity and all that stuff that she like
1191,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah for sure
1192,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,throws at you she's like you know that stuff right and it's like well i do
1193,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1194,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,but like a lot of people probably didn't
1195,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,i remembered enough to get by<ts>  but it would have been helpful to take chem for sure
1196,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah<ts>  yeah so that was like really helpful and like the first unit was like so easy for me because of that
1197,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1198,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,um<ts>  yeah also i just like think it's like you're like a logical progression like you need chem for bio but you don't need bio for chem
1199,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,right
1200,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,you know
1201,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,right
1202,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,um but like a lot of people do the other way and like that's fine<ts>  um<ts>  yeah it was hard coming in first semester and just like taking chem one right off the bat and like adjusting to college and like moving across the country and like college science classes
1203,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1204,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,like all my humanities classes are pretty comparable to my humanities classes in high school
1205,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,right
1206,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,so like i have a like a relatively like fine time with those
1207,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah yeah
1208,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,and this class just like knocked the wind out of me
1209,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,chem
1210,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1211,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1212,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,like i i just like didn't know how to take a science class you know<ts>  at college and then
1213,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,mm<ts>  especially cause they're big lecture halls and it's tough to like get any sort of relationship with the teacher
1214,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah right i'd like<ts>  yeah and i had never taken a class like that before
1215,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,like the first day in bio i had a question from her lecture so i'd started to walk up to her after class and then like fifty kids all clumped around her and i was like tch nope<ts>  sorry
1216,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah you just have to like unless it's like a huge question like you got to find a different way to answer it
1217,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1218,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah um you really have to supplement your like learning with other things i find
1219,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah mm very true
1220,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,and<ts>  like just kind of do it t for yourself in a way but yeah like chem one is f like chem is fine gen chem and i really liked chem two a lot more than chem one probably just cause i like had it down by then but like i had it down because i was working on it like twenty hours a week you know
1221,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,sh shit
1222,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,you're just like
1223,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1224,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,like that's just what you do
1225,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,okay
1226,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,cause you have like two problem sets a week that are really long and like take forever and you have a three hour lab a week and a lab report due every week and then you have the lectures and then you have three exams and a final and the exams are just like<ts>  but you get through it and it's fine and and then at the you're like
1227,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,looking forward to it
1228,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,you're like look at how much i accomplished

1269,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,or is it<ts>  huh
1270,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,um
1271,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,okay
1272,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,you mi you might you able to buy them online but i think you maybe it's only at like at the campus center i don't know i've never had to buy a ticket before because i've always been in it
1273,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,right yeah
1274,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,but i think i don't know if tickets cost i think they're free
1275,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,so there are four hundred half naked people<ts>  dancing on the stage
1276,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,uh huh<ts>  well like you know like dances might have like twenty people in them
1277,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,okay
1278,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,but yeah
1279,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,interesting
1280,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah it's really fun and like some of them are really good and then some of them are just like funny
1281,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1282,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,cause it's not really meant for people who are really good dancers<ts>  you know
1283,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah yeah yeah
1284,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,it's just like
1285,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,i heard about a is there a club called dancing for people who aren't good at dancing or is that this
1286,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,no there's tdc there's tufts dance collective
1287,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,no idea
1288,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,which is like kind of the same thing well no it's not the same thing at all actually it's like the same thing as in like the same structure like you have a choreo you have dances you have rehearsal once a week and it's not really meant for people who are good dancers but the culture around it is really different it's just like there are two shows at like there's a five pm show and there's a nine pm show people like no one really goes to like the five pm show then everyone in tdc gets like hammered in between and then there's their nine pm show and they're just like crawling out on stage like so drunk and you're like okay like they're having a lot of fun and you're just sitting there like i feel like i'm left out of some inside joke like this isn't fun for me to watch um yeah i don't i don't really like that as much cause also like ten people up getting temsed<ts>  
1289,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,oh shoot
1290,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,which is just like a lot and also they have like the highest funding of any club
1291,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1292,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,on campus because the school provides them with so much pizza to try to like soak up all the alcohol they're drinking so that people don't kill themselves but it's just like come on
1293,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,goodness
1294,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,like that's ridiculous but some people really like it<ts>  kinda
1295,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,mm
1296,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah<ts>  um so i do that um and peer health exchange which is like we go into public high schools in and around the boston area and teach a comprehensive health education class like for schools that don't have the resources to
1297,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,okay
1298,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,so that's cool
1299,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,very cool
1300,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah what about you
1301,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,have you done some teaching like did you run any health class
1302,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,um i just joined this year
1303,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,did you just like
1304,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,so i'm still like in the process
1305,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,okay<ts>  yeah
1306,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,um i've just passed my teaching evaluations so now i can like go in
1307,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,congrats
1308,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,thank you<ts>  um i it's kind of a long process though because it's it's like a big responsibility you know they're not gonna like throw you into a high school classroom so like there's a lot of training
1309,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah for sure
1310,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,so i think the first semester is more about training and stuff and then starting in like late november and december i'll teach a lot more and then next semester i'll teach a lot
1311,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,right
1312,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,but<ts>  i like it so far and it's like a cool thing i would say for premed students there's a lot of like things you can do to just like put on your resume but like ugh<ts>  like also it's your life you know you don't want to just waste your time being a part of clubs that don't actually interest you or like you don't feel like you're actually doing anything
1313,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1314,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,you know
1315,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah i get that for sure
1316,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,i dunno have you gotten involved in anything
1317,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,um a few things yeah just testing out the waters for now
1318,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1319,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,um i joined the club soccer team
1320,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,oh that's cool
1321,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah and
1322,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,club teams are such a great way to like make communities
1323,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah definitely
1324,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,m yeah
1325,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,um we actually got suspended for the year<ts>  long s long story
1326,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,why
1327,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,um
1328,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,we have time
1329,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,true<ts>  so um so we got the league schedule for games before we got the field schedule from tufts so we had a game scheduled on the week when we were supposed to share the field with the girls club team for practice so we asked the girls team if we could have the whole field to play against bu and they agreed and it was okay and then the club administration said no you can't do this that's title nine violation
1330,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,oh
1331,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,um and the captains decided that we should play anyways and they didn't think that the administration would find out and it b i mean honestly it wasn't a really big deal i thought like the girls team agreed um
1332,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah i think it's fine that like the girls team agreed but like the school takes what they can you know title nine violations like very seriously
1333,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah yeah
1334,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,and they kind of have to
1335,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,like yeah yeah um so we got suspended for a week because we played and then during that week we went to play brown
1336,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,mm
1337,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,um and the admin asked the captains if they had played like went down to play brown and they said no and then they asked brown if we had played them and brown said yes so
1338,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,wait why'd they lie about whether or not they went to play at brown
1339,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,cause we were suspended for that week that we went to play brown for<ts>  so
1340,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,okay well your captains are just dumb

1342,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,then
1343,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,but now we can't play so
1344,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,are you guys like doing anything do you like practice er
1345,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,uh a little bit yeah but<ts>  it's it's kind of just a group of guys getting together to play pick up rather than club practice
1346,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1347,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,cause we can't call it that

1380,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah i think that's good it's like it's such a big adjustment and everyone kind of underestimates how much of an adjustment college is going to be
1381,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,right
1382,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,um people are like oh it's going to be so fun like you're just gonna like slide right and like that's kinda true but also like it's a huge life adjustment
1383,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,mhm
1384,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,like<ts>  not only are you moving cities and like leaving everyone you've ever known but like your whole way of life changes like living at your school is like a huge difference from like living with your parents and whatever

1445,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,that's a lot to learn in three and a half weeks
1446,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah i'm like i'm sure for some people i don't know i'm thinking about taking orgo over the summer which is kind of like the same thing
1447,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,mm
1448,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,it's like six weeks which is like one class
1449,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah mm
1450,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,um
1451,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,would you take it somewhere in seattle
1452,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,no i would take it here
1453,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,like udub<ts>  oh you'd take it here
1454,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1455,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,mm
1456,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,um cause i don't i think it's just better to take it here
1457,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1458,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,cause then i can like go on my tufts transcript and like i my grade can transfer over to my gpa hopefully if i do well um yeah and i have a house here for next year
1459,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,okay
1460,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,and my lease starts<ts>  i'm not quite sure but like in the like the beginning of the summer
1461,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah so you're just gonna hang out here
1462,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,so i can just like<ts>  go right there<ts>  um
1463,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,mhm<ts>  i was thinking about taking it at dartmouth just cause it's right there
1464,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,mm
1465,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,but<ts>  um
1466,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,taking orgo<ts>  um
1467,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,i'd i guess it can't transfer though
1468,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,no it like it it won't be able to transfer to your tufts like transcript just cause it wasn't a tufts class but you'll have a separate dartmouth transcript and you'll still be able to complete that like pre med requirement
1469,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,right
1470,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,it'll just be like you took it at this school with like and you got this grade
1471,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,right<ts>  okay<ts>  yeah
1472,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,i mean obviously like dartmouth is a really good school and like they probably have a good like orgo class like i think you'd
1473,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah i would assume so
1474,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,i think you'd be fine
1475,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,okay
1476,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,um it's it it'd be just like if you didn't complete your pre med requirements like in your regular undergrad four years and then you were like do like a post bac and take those classes elsewhere it's like the same thing
1477,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,gotcha
1478,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,if that makes sense
1479,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah yeah
1480,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah<ts>  what makes you wanna be premed

1498,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah like
1499,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,do you think if your parents had been doctors you would've not wanted to be a doctor
1500,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,maybe cause then you like see kind of like the nitty gritty of it
1501,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,yeah
1502,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,like i definitely<ts>  like my parents work a lot<ts>  and they are writing briefs a lot
1503,2017-11-01-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,1,i can imagine

2479,2017-11-08-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,w why are they
2480,2017-11-08-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,and they took her from the school every single day
2481,2017-11-08-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,they don't want her to be have a social life
2482,2017-11-08-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,the apparently they do because like at at anytime she says this they're like we we drive you everywhere they do is true they drive her everywhere but like if she asks them to drive her like somewhere a bit sketchy they will be dead no so she do she just doesn't ask those<ts>  so they
2483,2017-11-08-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,do they do they let her to go in night clubs
2484,2017-11-08-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,to night clubs<ts>  mm yes and no if like it's her like friends<ts>  uh mostly girlfriends they might but like she would at most be that she would return not so late
