1914,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,like it just makes sense like logically if you just read it that makes sense
1915,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,yeah no i know it makes sense but i'm
1916,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,it'll take such a short amount a time
1917,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,i know<ts>  oh i started like taking notes a little differently
1918,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,okay
1919,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,like instead of like taking notes as i go i'll like read a page and then like jot down a few things after i read the page
1920,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,yeah yeah yeah
1921,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,and then do that instead of like really super intense note taking
1922,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,right
1923,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,but um<ts>  but yeah i have to i wanted to type up my lectures from like the past few weeks but i don't think that's gonna happen
1924,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,not a priority
1925,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,not a priority exactly so i think what i'm gonna do is instead of typing them up as i go like that'll be my studying is like typing up my lectures because there's just no way to do it as i go if i like
1926,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,yeah

2105,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,those the walls are so weird i'm excited to live next year somewhere where the halls are straight because then like when you walk out of your room you can see other people
2106,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,yeah
2107,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,and not just like a wall
2108,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,and not startl oh i startle myself every single time
2109,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,i did i scare you coming out of the bathroom the other day<ts>  was that you or was it somebody else i like really scared somebody walking out of bathroom
2110,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,it was probably me i don't reme oh yeah it was me<ts>  and then i like when i was you like collapsed on the ground laughing and coughing

2148,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,and this was like in the th second week of school i was like wow
2149,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,that's so funny
2150,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,i was like dripping in sweat after a marathon run like i clearly needed a shower
2151,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,aw

2159,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,yeah
2160,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,like i could see her
2161,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,yeah
2162,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,but like i had my door open was like coming to close my door i had my towel and i had all my stuff

2166,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,and like
2167,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,that's fair though i mean the sh i never like i always shower at weird ti weird times because like i just shower after lift between class but now i shower at like night because we have practice so late but i feel like i haven't had to wait that long for shower ever because i'm not showering at peak shower time
2168,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,peak shower time
2169,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,but yeah i i have mad like respect for people who could um shower before class before their eight thirties
2170,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,some people have to do it like they're like i must shower in the morning like
2171,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,which is fair i think
2172,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,i'm a night showerer
2173,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,i'm a night showerer too also because i work out during the day i feel like it's pointless to shower before
2174,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,and also like when i get in my bed i want to be clean
2175,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,but
2176,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,like i don't like the idea that like i'm getting in my bed with today's germs on
2177,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,yes i that's how i feel<ts>  yes i feel that way too i don't like to sit in my bed until i've showered
2178,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,yeah
2179,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,which like i'll i'll do it but i don't like too
2180,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,like i'll sit on the bed but not like
2181,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,but not in yeah yeah especially if i'm sweaty oo nope i can't do it
2182,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,it's okay
2183,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,i'm tired
2184,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,i really don't want to go to office hours today
2185,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,i don't blame you
2186,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,but i haven't done any of the work like i just don't know how
2187,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,is it this is comp fifteen
2188,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,it's not like i yeah it's not like i i n have the work where i'm you know what if i go to office hours it will just be like a little easier it's like i have to go because i have no idea how to do the work
2189,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,yeah what is what is what are you doing
2190,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,it's an expansion o have you ever taken computer science at all
2191,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,nope i have like zero knowledge of computer science
2192,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,it's like<ts>  i hadn't last semester too
2193,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,oh okay
2194,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,going into comp eleven<ts>  it's they take the last thing that we learned in comp eleven which is um uh data structures like arrays which are like lists
2195,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,mhm
2196,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,of items and they like make a class out of it<ts>  so it's like all the different types of data structures you can have
2197,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,oh<ts>  interesting
2198,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,in computer science
2199,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,that sounds hard computer science just sounds hard to me in general cause it seems like it's not it's like a different language which it it is i guess technically
2200,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,i think it's difficult for me because they give us a week to do the homework<ts>  and because it's a lecture style class it's not one on one so like if i have a question like i have to prioritize my questions
2201,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,yes
2202,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,like i can't ask every single question that comes to my head
2203,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,yeah
2204,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,during lecture and because i can't do that i then forget the question and then i don't remember t that i need to know it
2205,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,mhm
2206,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,until i'm doing the homework and i'm like i have no idea what this means because i didn't ask that question
2207,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,mhm
2208,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,but like i can't raise my hand every five minutes
2209,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,five minutes
2210,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,and be like i have a question
2211,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,yeah yeah
2212,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,i have question and the other day oh my god the other day in discrete math i raised my hand with a question because she gave gives out handouts and worksheets but at the beginning of the semester she didn't realize how many people were in the class so she didn't make enough
2213,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,oh no
2214,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,so i didn't get one of the first worksheets
2215,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,uh huh
2216,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,or handouts<ts>  so the next class she referenced something that had been on the work or the handout
2217,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,oh and you di have it
2218,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,that i didn't have so i raised my hand i was like um what's that symbol and she goes class and the whole cla like the whole lecture goes for all<ts>  like it was a symbol for like the for all
2219,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,yeah yeah for all symbol
2220,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,and i was like<ts>  okay i was like i turned to my neighbor i was like did i miss that and she goes i don't know<ts>  like we were both so sho like i was like oh my god
2221,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,i'm surprised that she would like kind of embarrass you like that
2222,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,well and then the next day i had a she she's also my comp e fifteen teacher so she came over to me it was like<ts>  hey like i'm really sorry about yesterday i didn't mean to embarrass you like i realized that we never talked about it in lecture and it was just on the worksheet and i was like yeah i just didn't get the worksheet she's like it's fine i was like it's really fine i don't care
2223,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,yeah no it's fine that's just so uncomfortable
2224,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,cause she me she embarrassed someone even more later cause the guy raised his hand and was like and she never does this<ts>  like
2225,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,yeah i mean
2226,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,this is so out of character for her
2227,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,which is fine i think some people<ts>  like i get wh why that would be frustrating like i had teachers in high school who would do that and like i loved them and they were great people and i knew that that wasn't in their character it was just like they were frustrated with like people it like wasn't you but it was like other
2228,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,yeah yeah<ts>  oop don't do that
2229,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,people<ts>  i can't talk with my hands
2230,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,um<ts>  i know yeah i know<ts>  yeah he raised his hand he was like how do i do this how would i know how to do this she goes you would have written it down in lecture uh you would have written it down in class when your professor told you to t was t was talking about it or something like that and the whole class was like oooh
2231,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,oh god that's like so middle school
2232,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,it's but to be fair the kid was not paying attention at all he had been talking the whole class
2233,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,oh okay
2234,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,and she knew
2235,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,was it a small class
2236,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,no it's hu it's in barnum oh oh eight we fill every seat in barnum oh oh eight
2237,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,this is so weird
2238,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,so weird
2239,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,wait<ts>  this is it i wonder what the purpose of this set up is
2240,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i feel like to make us like it just makes us like uncomfortable which is weird cause like if they're trying to figure out like
2241,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,like normal social interaction
2242,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah
2243,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,so maybe they're not trying to figure out totally normal social in i like this this is like a mirror like do you feel like this will h this thing is weird
2244,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,it's so weird
2245,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,it's weird cause i can hear you so clearly
2246,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah
2247,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i don't know this is like offsetting is i don't know what the word is<ts>  they're watching us
2248,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah
2249,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i feel like it's weird that this t like video goes somewhere that we can that can be accessed by anybody
2250,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i i know<ts>  but like
2251,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,it's interesting
2252,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah
2253,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i wonder if this lab is just like the purpose is to collect a ton of data but they must they must do something with it

2380,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,like i would imagine i don't know i didn't see anything
2381,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i know it's just that tin of cookies in the middle and those don't even look like good cookies
2382,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah i feel like those tins like people reuse a lot like who even knows if there were cookies in there
2383,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,right<ts>  okay what time is it ten thirty so i guess by the time we get back i could just go to carm
2384,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,mhm
2385,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i wonder if like other age people participate in this i w i think that just like all of psychology is based off of college psychology students
2386,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,mhm
2387,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,which i would say is a flaw
2388,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah
2389,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,because i think there's a lot of i mean there's a lot of different people who study psychology but there's also some like similar similarities i feel like in like amongst a lot of people
2390,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,definitely
2391,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,s
2392,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i know
2393,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,so it's like i mean also like it's social psych there's always like a small chapter at the of each or a small section at the of each chapter where they're talking about cultural differences and how like
2394,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,mhm
2395,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,um<ts>  and how<ts>  like that's a thing that we haven't really totally explored yet
2396,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,mhm
2397,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,but they'll give like a few references to like the few studies that have been done in japan or like canada
2398,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah
2399,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,which is yeah<ts>  i like your out i have my nails painted for so long and then i was like i just wanna have not painted nails

2408,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,ugh
2409,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,that would be nice
2410,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah
2411,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,this is so odd i don't know i guess it's not that odd
2412,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,no it really it is like they try to make it creepy or something

2414,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah
2415,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yea<ts>  like i wonder who built this building like do they have to specifically design weird compartments for weird psych studies<ts>  or do they have to like come in and do renovations
2416,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i guess so<ts>  hm<ts>  interesting i don't know<ts>  hm
2417,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i think we get to leave after this<ts>  right
2418,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah i think so
2419,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,that's kinda nice<ts>  but also i feel like it's gonna take way longer
2420,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i know i feel
2421,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,like i wonder when she's gonna come back i didn't really look at the time we got in here

2424,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah
2425,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,but it when you would just ask the super basic questions
2426,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah but then like what do you learn from that like what are they learn
2427,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,right
2428,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,she's like so surface level
2429,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,they learn like what freshman year of college looks like
2430,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah
2431,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,and recruitment for sororities
2432,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah
2433,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,oh yeah i think i'm gonna drop my sorority but<ts>  i don't know i think i am<ts>  i just don't know if i'm thinking it through fully like are there things that i'm
2434,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,just putting my feet up
2435,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,oh<ts>  i thought you see through
2436,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,mm can you see you can see my feet
2437,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,oh i guess so
2438,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,um<ts>  yeah i don't know
2439,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,like are there th like am i not considering it like am i being impulsive almost like i i just really have trouble making decisions and i don't know like how to fix that necessarily<ts>  um
2440,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i don't think you're being impulsive cause like
2441,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i've been thinking about it for a while
2442,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,you've been thinking about it the whole time
2443,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,but i don't really know like what i'm actually thinking<ts>  i guess i'm thinking i think a lot of it unfortunately is also like<ts>  like outside influence like my family when i went to that wedding they were like<ts>  oh you joined a sorority like didn't we talk about not t like one of my cousins was didn't we talk about this cause we did we talked about what we were we did girls cousins weekends last year
2444,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah
2445,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,um<ts>  we were in a hotel and there was like a sorority conference going on but it was crazy because they were like singing songs and i was like this is
2446,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah it's totally different
2447,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah that's it yeah but i<ts>  and like my dad he's like fine but he was like like my mom was supportive like when i originally but then asked me when i was texting hannah morgan and my mom i was like who supports me dropping and they were all like me<ts>  but like i don't know<ts>  huh
2448,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah i don't know
2449,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i think really it's like one of the the biggest things is that i have tems
2450,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,if<ts>  yeah
2451,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,and it like kind of is already that group it's just like easier and like i know i'm sure i'm sure the sorority would get better and but it's just that i'm already in a group that like fills that need as well as like being something else<ts>  i don't know also i don't know whether she wrote for tems board especially after last night it seems so hard to plan a social
2452,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,mhm
2453,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,like tell you planned it and then not a lot of people said they were gonna go but she sent out an email to all of us and she like put mike in charge and then<ts>  we kinda a did i tell you we have like one of our friends ended up sitting there for like a long time
2454,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah
2455,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,and so like i just felt so bad i was like wow this is a stressful job and its har
2456,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i think you could be good at it though
2457,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,thanks
2458,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah i do
2459,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,it's just like an means i'm committing to like not study abroad in the fall<ts>  and i watched a movie about chile or chile<ts>  i s
2460,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,did you see there's like a tufts in chile in like
2461,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah did we miss the madrid one
2462,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,pizza party<ts>  yeah
2463,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,oh<ts>  whoops
2464,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,when's gonna be when is the the cadiz one
2465,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,the cadiz<ts>  yeah
2466,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,come on
2467,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,the thing is<ts>  the chile program i think would be really tough because well i don't think i would do the tufts one necessarily but it would be really like when katie was saying her sister who is like so fluent in french had such a hard time taking classes at french university there's no way
2468,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,it's terrifying
2469,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i could take classes in a spanish it's just that the problem is setting myself up for failure it's setting me up for so much stress when study abroad's supposed to be really fun a time when you don't take s like so many classes so that you have time to um travel
2470,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah
2471,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,so in like the cadiz program it feels very low stress and also you get a semester of spanish out of the way which is like helpful for me no matter what like it would not be a wasted credit
2472,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,mhm
2473,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,because i need to take spanish<ts>  even for my six requirements like that would be my sixth so it'd just be fulfilling like a normal tufts distribution and then i wonder if like the culture one like is there are art thing we could take i don't know how that works
2474,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,one eight
2475,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,like would it count for an art credit potentially
2476,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,no it's it would count
2477,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,it's just a spanish culture
2478,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,it would count for like a spanish culture if you're doing like the
2479,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,oh
2480,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,four and two type thing
2481,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,okay
2482,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,or something like that
2483,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,so i guess that's kind of a waste but at the same time i would still be learning like hopefully so much spanish
2484,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah
2485,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,which is more like the goal than like meeting any requirements
2486,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah<ts>  very true
2487,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,and it seems super fun li i mean look look at the people who went to talloires<ts>  that seemed really fun
2488,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,mhm
2489,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,seemed like you get to travel a lot
2490,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah like it'll be even better for us cause we're actually like taking classes in a language and like
2491,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,right
2492,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,learning it
2493,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,right right is like
2494,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,talloiresis english
2495,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah<ts>  it would be so great we could be so fluent
2496,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i want you to come
2497,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah
2498,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,we should do that this summer and then you study abroad in the spring
2499,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i think<ts>  okay that would make sense i would have to check i don't think that there's not south american programs in the spring i think it's just that the weather's not as great
2500,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,mm kay
2501,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,but also i can investigate cause they<ts>  my father made a good point like the closer to the equator you are it's just gonna be hotter
2502,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,the warmer<ts>  yeah
2503,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,all year round<ts>  and anything is better than boston if we not anything but i think on the whole it will just be much more mild
2504,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,mhm
2505,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,um but then i'd probably be going by myself potentially i don't really know a lot of people who are talking about south america in the spring
2506,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,mhm
2507,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,but also<ts>  who was i talking to somebody in the sorority was like going to cuba next semester which i think is eally cool she
2508,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah
2509,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,oh hannah
2510,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,oh
2511,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,um she was also telling me about this club she has called cores<ts>  um
2512,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,never heard of it
2513,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,it's they go in and teach english classes to adults whose first language is spanish
2514,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i feel like i have heard of that actually
2515,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,in the community<ts>  but it just seems such like such a cool club
2516,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,it sounds familiar
2517,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,like you know how i was kind of looking for i think i'm kind of back on the hunt for new cool club
2518,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah
2519,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,that i wanna do
2520,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,sorority
2521,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,yeah after that it was cause i was like oh i have two things now i'm back to like one<ts>  um kind of plus that other thing that i do sometimes and complain about
2522,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,mhm

2524,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,mhm
2525,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,i think this is gonna be funny when we see the transcript we can could count how many words i say versus how many words you say
2526,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,oh my god<ts>  yeah that will be interesting

3103,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yep
3104,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,it's like a two way mirror but only a one way mirror or
3105,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah
3106,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,or all way mirror i don't know not really mirror
3107,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,or is mirror the reality<ts>  question mark
3108,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,isn't it by definition a reflection of reality
3109,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,whatever you whatever you think man
3110,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,if you could see through it would it would just be a no way mirror right a zero way mirror
3111,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i guess yeah<ts>  or a one
3112,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,are one way mirrors the one that you can see through<ts>  a from one side but not the other side
3113,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,this is an existential conversation we're having
3114,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah i feel like it probably would cause a twoway mirror would be reflective on both sides and you wouldn't be able to see much through it
3115,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,astute<ts>  astute sir
3116,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,this room is weird i feel like i'm in a padded room
3117,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i feel like you're in front of a green screen and i should be seeing like some kind of like
3118,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,like some nice visuals in the back
3119,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,interesting background<ts>  yeah there personal question for you if you could be in front of any green screen background what would it be
3120,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i quite like the green in the background green's my favorite color i think i' m just happy with this
3121,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,man of simplicity
3122,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,what would you
3123,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,wow
3124,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,would you prefer to be in front of fake backgrounds
3125,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,well see<ts>  neon green disturbs me
3126,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,we can't be friends then
3127,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,fine that's fine i don't
3128,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,neon green is like the third best green
3129,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,no
3130,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah absolutely
3131,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,muted colors are always the most elegant<ts>  what are you talking about
3132,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,muted colors like what what's a muted what would you even consider a muted color
3133,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,like<ts>  like forest green is an acceptable green because it's not like in your face you know it's like a polite green that asks you how are you and doesn't like punch you in the face like neon green does
3134,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,on one hand i agree because forest green is obviously the best green
3135,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,of course you agree because i'm always right
3136,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i i would say it's more that forest green is just the best green
3137,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,neon green sucks
3138,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,that being said that being said<ts>  neon green is one of the best greens<ts>  but it's not the best
3139,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,no you're wrong
3140,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,but it's it's close

3142,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,the tree wait do you have a tree too
3143,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yes i think so if you count tha yeah that's a tree

3331,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i'm just cooler than you i'm sorry
3332,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah like evidently
3333,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i i know it's yeah i know it's a disappointment but yeah
3334,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i was your family as
3335,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,now you know<ts>  no verne
3336,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,that wasn't even a shot that was he was shot
3337,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,burn shots fi but i i'm so offended i don't even<ts>  i can't even i'm having too many feelings
3338,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i don't even know how to<ts>  if you go to take a break and um crash
3339,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah
3340,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i would feel but no i wouldn't feel but i mean it's all it that well that i t wasn't even meant that way at all
3341,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,you wouldn't even feel ba<ts>  do you feel while
3342,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,well i mean if you're crying out i have like a
3343,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,good an ice cold heart<ts>  could just
3344,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,there's like a baseline of like sadness like empathy maybe but
3345,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,well
3346,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i don't think it's<ts>  deserves so
3347,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,empathy is very important and it's a defining factor in emotional intelligence did you know that
3348,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i didn't know that but last night we were watching planet earth two and they were talking about animal intuition and i was just like like i was just my mind was blown by the fact that there's like intuition like you don't even i don't know it doesn't make sense to me i don't know<ts>  like i can't comprehend intuition
3349,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,what do you mean<ts>  like<ts>  in general
3350,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah<ts>  cause like
3351,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,it's like a sixth sense it's just a feeling you get
3352,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah but where does that come from
3353,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,lives you know
3354,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,how how does like a
3355,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i think we i feel like we develop it because we learn a lot about social interactions and we kind of pick um
3356,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah but how do like baby turtles know to go towards the light
3357,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,well they're biologically programmed i would think there's certain cells in t he brain
3358,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,but what is the biological programming like this is where i'm confused
3359,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,well we we're kind of talking about that in psych nine a little bit like the brain like brain plasticity and how like the brain adapts to certain situations i guess
3360,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,where i'm lost
3361,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,throughout the evolution
3362,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,but<ts>  but it's saying that it can become like pre that they can come for it out did
3363,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah
3364,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,that's crazy
3365,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,a lot of animal do that we're some of the only
3366,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,so should not be like evidence for like physical
3367,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,like
3368,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,like there's a physical<ts>  part of like memory
3369,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah yeah the brain is constantly like reconfiguring itself throughout the evolution of the species like i feel like we're the only ones that have to develop like after were born like a lot of animals just come pre programm ed already but some
3370,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah but i feel like i like all animals word
3371,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,thanks
3372,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i don't think learning is outside of the room
3373,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,no no they demonstrate learning but i feel like we are the only ones t hat are were born the most help i mean if you think about it like a baby zebra or something will walking within like a day to and we're like just vegetated dental work
3374,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah
3375,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,two and a half so
3376,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i guess i guess animals that are like<ts>  protected by their mothers are much more hopeless<ts>  general i i guess i w ould agree with that
3377,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah that's true where were very spoiled species
3378,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,cause like animals like i i was just thinking like if you're born alone you have to come out of your egg alone and you just know<ts>  like that you need to go towards the water<ts>  not in the full moon and stuff like that like
3379,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah that's true<ts>  although some animals were demonstrated to sh demonstrate um they show altruism so like if their kid is in some kind of danger they will sacrifice themselves so animals do that
3380,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah i feel like altruism is like a pretty explainable<ts>  thing
3381,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah
3382,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,like i'm like
3383,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,like and imprinting and stuff like that
3384,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah definitely i don't like i must not fully understand the like<ts>  the controversy around um<ts>  whatever we were just talking about which i have forgotten
3385,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,intuition altruism<ts>  imprinting
3386,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,altruism<ts>  altruism yeah yeah yeah
3387,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,okay
3388,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i feel like i don't understand the controversy around altruism i feel like it's pretty explainable like like fitness trait
3389,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i guess yeah i mean i don't know it's kind of like if you are on the team of survival of the fittest then it's kinda strange that a fit mother would for example sacrifice herself to protect her sickly child like that seems kind of counter intuitive but then
3390,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i think sickly it might be a defining characteristic which would make altruism not really as important<ts>  i i think i feel like altruism makes sense a lot if you view the goal as passing on your genes
3391,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,why what do you mean
3392,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,if your kids are like
3393,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,meaning if the kids are healthy<ts>  and they're being in
3394,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,if you're yeah so it's in your best interest to keep your it's much easier to keep a kid healthy than it is to literally become pregnant and then like have the kid again
3395,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,okay<ts>  gotcha<ts>  okay
3396,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,so it's like within your it's in your best interest to keep them alive
3397,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i'll give it to you
3398,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i feel like i
3399,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,that's true that makes sense
3400,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i don't know maybe it's too like utilitarian<ts>  where to look at it i don't know
3401,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,at the the world is brutal i mean there's no democracy over there it's just like you sick bye
3402,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,right
3403,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,see ya
3404,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah like that's
3405,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,so no health care<ts>  for the animals
3406,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,it<ts>  it's so human to like project and anthropomorphize stuff
3407,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah for sure
3408,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,and just like<ts>  give it like you know personify things but
3409,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah
3410,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,in reality like things don't care there's no mercy there's no empathy like
3411,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,nope<ts>  not at all i mean i we were learning a lot about that in psych twenty eight last semester about um self reference and self generation and things like you're more l kely to remember things and you're more likely to understand things if you do them yourself and you relate them to yourself somehow
3412,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,mhm
3413,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,so human beings have this tendency to
3414,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,relate things
3415,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,focus on themselves a lot
3416,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah
3417,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah<ts>  sure
3418,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,that stuff was crazy
3419,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah
3420,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i love psychology so much
3421,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,me too
3422,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i'm so excited

3695,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,at all<ts>  i mean
3696,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i wouldn't declare a comp sci minor<ts>  or anything like that until you've done comp
3697,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,although i i d i do know some comes i jokes like hey you're boolean me so mean
3698,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,boolean<ts>  false
3699,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,equals equals
3700,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,or true
3701,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,equals equals true because you're mean to me
3702,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,equals equals<ts>  yeah there's like i remember what the equals equals is there's equals equals equals and then like<ts>  not equal to which is exclamation point and equal it's just it's just a lot like i don't know it's all syntax
3703,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,y you're just scaring me now
3704,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i really don't like language<ts>  i love language i love languages<ts>  but i hate la learning it
3705,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,like actual language but not
3706,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,like i does don't at all want to be involved in learning them
3707,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,that too
3708,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i just think they're cool and like
3709,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,what language are you taking for your credits
3710,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i took latin three semesters
3711,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,oh that's really cool
3712,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,it was like sick yeah it was it was like a fifteen person class
3713,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,do you like it
3714,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,with like a super like the best professor
3715,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,can you like create a new harry potter spell or something
3716,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,no but like it's actually pretty sick like being able to read
3717,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,that's really cool
3718,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,um<ts>  like i'm i did alm i did very little of the translation homework but like some kids i know like are actually fluent in latin it's crazy
3719,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,supposed to do your homework sir it's not very studious
3720,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,it wasn't graded<ts>  so no incentive
3721,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah i still have to take my french culture class and then i'll be done i got almost all my credits from high school
3722,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,lucky
3723,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,but i really should've taken that russian placement exam that would probably make things easier for me
3724,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,if you would well you can in order to place out of a language you can do two languages to twelve like a three class level
3725,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,mhm
3726,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,or you could do one language to like anywhere from three to six and then like culture classes and stuff
3727,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,gotcha
3728,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,but if you'd place into like russian four and french four you would've been completely done with your requirement
3729,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah i mean the thing is like i am aware of the fact that most of my russian is very casual and conversational and i can read and all that but actual like writing compositions that are formal and whatever i i don't have the skills for that so i feel like i would probably struggle in high level russian class
3730,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah
3731,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,cause you have to do everything i can just<ts>  you know make jokes and whatever and i can interact
3732,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,you could take like russian three though and then just do one year of rush one semester of russian and be done but whatever<ts>  it's too late
3733,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah i mean it's fine i i pla practice enogh russian with my family and all that so
3734,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,mhm
3735,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i'll just learn about french culture
3736,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i have a friend<ts>  one of the kids in my suite is from honduras and like it's funny because even though honduras obviously is a spanish speaking country like primarily he um grew up in like pr he went to like private schools that taught english
3737,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,hm
3738,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,um so english is like like really his best language his first language um and spanish he's very conversational but he's like it's funny cause we have like four five kids who take spanish in the suite and they all like call him out so often on like grammar
3739,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,hm
3740,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,and like spelling mistakes and stuff
3741,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,so funny<ts>  thing is about learning a language um like as a just in your family or whatever it's really interesting because conversationally you are much more likely to have an interesting conversation with someone than people who learn it formally like i had that experience with french like when i talk to people who knew french slang and things like that like it's almost a separate thing in of itself to know all the slang and i feel like it's just it's not as interesting like versus writing at somebody who only has an oral education writing is impossible<ts>  but then people who are formally educated can write an essay and all
3742,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah
3743,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,so i don't know<ts>  what else whatever's more useful you know
3744,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah but like<ts>  i f i feel like it's more of a function of like if you learn it conversationally you learn vocab and then you learn grammar
3745,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i yeah
3746,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah like you learn those at the same time and
3747,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,grammar becomes kind of intuitive almost
3748,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah
3749,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,because it's like trial and error
3750,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,you can just pick up on it yeah
3751,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah yeah yeah
3752,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,but when you learn it formally there's no like actual practicing the way that like
3753,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,mm
3754,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,at least in my experience there was no actual practice in the way that like immersion is practice
3755,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,mhm
3756,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,and as such like vocab kinda just is fleeting like you learn it for a month to get pass the test but then you move on
3757,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,it's yeah it's so much easier to learn it kind of on the way i think languages are more like gradual that way i feel like learning them formally it's almost counterproductive
3758,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,it sucks i hate languages
3759,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah
3760,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i hate languages the only time i would ever like i would be down to learn another language but i would only do it for immersion
3761,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,russian
3762,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i wouldn't do it
3763,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,russian learn russian
3764,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,i'm not learning russian

3766,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,russian doesn't have the same alphabet does it
3767,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,come on<ts>  no it's really different
3768,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,yeah i'm not doing that

3774,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,hi
3775,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,no that

3822,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i'm pretty sure the milk was actually bad<ts>  so i don't wanna say anything though
3823,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,really<ts>  oh that's so gross
3824,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but it like flaked off and i smelled it and it was gross so was just like
3825,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,did you put it in your
3826,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,no
3827,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i wonder if that's part of the experiment
3828,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i was thinking that the whole time like what is part of the experiment
3829,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah there was one time that i was tricked for one of these for intro to psych
3830,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,oh really
3831,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah um like the other participant was actually a plant<ts>  so like when i first came in and saw you i thought that you were a plant<ts>  yeah that was pretty rough but anyway so you're gonna do consulting where is that gonna be
3832,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,luckily in boston
3833,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,nice
3834,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah<ts>  i i'm so uh i'm not sure if you know anything about consulting but
3835,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,like a little
3836,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah i i unfortunately do
3837,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,okay
3838,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but um i'm choosing between a firm called oliver weinmann and another one called deloitte so i
3839,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,oh yeah i know deloitte
3840,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah i just have to make make a decision at some point in the next week
3841,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i've heard of that<ts>  yeah<ts>  geez
3842,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,although i assume
3843,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,congrats
3844,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah it's funny cause i'm an english major
3845,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,right
3846,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and i could not be dumber at eighty percent of the stuff that you need for consulting
3847,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but cause it don't they like ask you stuff during the interview like how many marbles will fit in an airplane
3848,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,oh yeah<ts>  it's a ton of math and i can't i'm in psych stats for my math requirement
3849,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah<ts>  so like clearly not
3850,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
3851,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,like a math person
3852,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,it's so bad i had some guy ask me i was doing it's you do these things called mark uh market sizing where they'll ask you how many cabs are let's say in new york city
3853,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,okay<ts>  okay
3854,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and you just have to figure it out from mentally
3855,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
3856,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,thinking about all these factors and i had to do something like seven times forty two hundred and i looked at the guy and i was like look there's not an answer i don't know i'm gonna be honest and he was like okay
3857,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's so stressful but you got it that's kind of cool
3858,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah seven yeah that that was a different one but somehow that went okay
3859,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,wow<ts>  nice
3860,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah you meet the ust you meet the oddest people
3861,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,uh huh
3862,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,for like for that one i completely fucked up every part of it but the whole day they were saying you know we have this guy named hank he's brilliant he's your last interview they're like our clients can't get enough of hank and then this guy waddles in in the
3863,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm
3864,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and he's like clearly neurotic he's got like overlapping bottom teeth and he has my resume and he keeps flipping it over and over even know there's nothing on the back
3865,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm<ts>  oh my god i can't i like know exactly the kind of person you're talking
3866,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and i'm thinking like holy shit<ts>  yeah
3867,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,about
3868,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and then he's like alright i'm gonna give you a graph and i want you to solve it so he writes this graph with like eleven different lines going
3869,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm
3870,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and he's like all right solve this and i'm like i don't know what the fuck i'm looking at<ts>  so i making shit up and he's like that's all wrong and then he takes it back and he's like i drew it wrong he crosses everything out gives me like another eleven lines and i'm like dude i can't read it and he's like of course<ts>  and he takes it back does anoth nother one a new one and gives it to me and i was like i and he's like you know what i drew it wrong again and i was like okay
3871,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,did he ever draw it right
3872,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,no he was like let's just do let's just talk
3873,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i wonder if that was part of the test
3874,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i think he's just c uh my idea is that he goes into a conference room everyday
3875,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm
3876,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and gets like everything wrong and everyone at the company is like he's brilliant he's done it again
3877,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's so crazy wow
3878,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,he's my idol it was like it was a firm called novantis and it's extremely analytical
3879,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,okay
3880,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,modeling for finance
3881,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,okay
3882,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,which is pretty much like the absolute opposite of what i'd be good at
3883,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,okay
3884,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but he's a philosophy major
3885,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,oh cool
3886,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and he's like a huge partner at it and i was like you're my hero
3887,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's awesome
3888,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
3889,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i'm a big proponent of people just like majoring in whatever they like and then just doing something else random with it
3890,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
3891,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,um that's kind of what i'm doing with anthropology i think like just i'm not gonna do anything with anthropology probably in my future but i like it
3892,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,oh really<ts>  what was the other one biology
3893,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,so<ts>  biology
3894,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's a pretty good one to have
3895,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah yeah uh
3896,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i have a lot of respect for that because of the amount that i would be bad at it<ts>  would be astronomical
3897,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i bet you could do it i mean it's honestly just like memorizing patterns and then applying those patterns to other things and like once you understand like how something
3898,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that does make it sound pretty good
3899,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah so like once you learn how to play the biology game
3900,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
3901,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,like you're good it's like orgo like
3902,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,for english once you know how to read you're set
3903,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,see that's what i'm struggling with right now oh my god i
3904,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,you're really good
3905,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,oh my god i am questioning my like general reading comprehension comprehension i have to like present on these two like uh one ten page reading and one twenty page reading for my class on wednesday i spent literally all of saturday trying to read these thirty pages and i just like and they were so simple they were like ethnographic just like a story and i was just like so i don't know i i think like i'm a senior in college but i still like can't comprehend readings
3906,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,do you ever have to write essays for any of your classes
3907,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,anthropology all the time
3908,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,oh okay
3909,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,so
3910,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,there you go
3911,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i mean i used to be able to do it i think somewhere like within the past six months i just like forgot how to do
3912,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
3913,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,reading and writing
3914,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's my fear is that i'll graduate i'm gonna go into uh consulting which i find really interesting
3915,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm<ts>  uh huh
3916,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but i don't know if i'm gonna have to be writing in the same way that i write now
3917,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,uh huh
3918,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and mainly i have to also say that cause if this is out there i really need to talk about the fact that i do like consulting
3919,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah yeah yeah
3920,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
3921,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,can you actually explain like why consulting firms hire students directly out of college like who presumably don't have the experience of the people that they're consulting for like that's something that's
3922,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
3923,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i think is an interesting phenomenon
3924,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,probably just because uh we're cheaper
3925,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,okay
3926,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,than an actual experienced hire
3927,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that makes sense
3928,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah also i think to b like consulting itself means absolutely nothing
3929,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's what i've always thought
3930,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah it means the word itself means definitely nothing because it could mean anything
3931,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,okay
3932,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i mean if i was telling my dad which shoe to put on i'd be consulting him
3933,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,right fair
3934,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but um a lot of people say the job of the consultant is to take someone's watch off their arm and tell them what time it is
3935,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,okay
3936,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i i mean i don't know if that's true or not cause i i did it last summer but i don't really know what it's like
3937,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,cool
3938,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,to do for couple years
3939,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,uh huh
3940,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i just think you get to learn so much about so many different industries
3941,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm
3942,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and your only job is to learn and the idea is that a third party who is supposed to be smart from a good college
3943,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's cool<ts>  mhm
3944,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,will be able to have some insight into what someone else is doing
3945,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm
3946,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,maybe they're too engrossed to be able to see
3947,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,oh okay
3948,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,so you get to have a lot of experience in a lot of t different industries
3949,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's cool
3950,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,so yeah for that stuff i think it's gonna be really fun
3951,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah that is gonna be fun
3952,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but<ts>  i've also heard my hours are from seven am to twelve am so
3953,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,nice
3954,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,might be tough for me
3955,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah okay well you just won't have a social life but weekends

4024,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,even spending a lot of time in a hospital i'd be like i must've contracted something today
4025,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i definitely got pink eye one time from work
4026,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,really
4027,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah<ts>  it was really sad
4028,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's horrible
4029,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,because i think i like do a lot of hand sanitation you know like i'm always

4032,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah that i couldn't do that<ts>  yeah
4033,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah<ts>  it's fun though
4034,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that is really cool to me and this is an odd opinion i mean i think my profession will be extremely fun
4035,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm
4036,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and i'll get to learn a lot but i view almost being a doctor as the only meaningful
4037,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm<ts>  oh
4038,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,profession<ts>  that i can think of other than being a teacher which is what i want to do in my like fifties
4039,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah<ts>  oh that's a really cool path

4042,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and then immediately become an english teacher
4043,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,smart very smart yeah cause you can't do that starting with english teaching probably or it
4044,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah<ts>  i cannot
4045,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,it will be a lot harder i guess
4046,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah the jump from english teacher to consulting will be much more difficult
4047,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah yeah
4048,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4049,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,neat
4050,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but
4051,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,sounds like you've got a good<ts>  plan though
4052,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah i realize my plan will definitely fall through
4053,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,why
4054,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,uh i feel i mean my dad wanted i think he wanted to be a history teacher when he was my age and we are the exact same person in every way
4055,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm<ts>  mhm
4056,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but now he's been a lawyer for like thirty years and he started out doing it for
4057,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,oh
4058,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,people who were uh what's it like labor law
4059,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,okay
4060,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but now he does intellectual property law for merck and pfizer
4061,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,what does that mean
4062,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,uh pretty much let's say you're merck do you know you know uh
4063,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,merck yeah the the drug company
4064,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah<ts>  so let's say that they have a new drug they need to patent it so that no one else can pretty much use the same drug and that they can collect all the market from it
4065,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mm<ts>  mhm<ts>  mhm
4066,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,my dad makes sure that when that patent is challenged by another company let's say merck thinks that oh pfizer came out with something but it's too similar to ours
4067,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm<ts>  mhm
4068,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and they don't want it to be sold to anyone else my dad will go in and be like errerererer<ts>  and pretty much make sure that merck uh keeps their patent and that pfizer can't sell whatever they sold
4069,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,wow
4070,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah which there are
4071,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's interesting
4072,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,societal benefits but mainly societal downsides too
4073,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah i guess so i mean<ts>  drug companies are interesting and like a tough thing for me to wrap my head around because like
4074,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4075,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,their bottom line like yes they're bettering the world with medicine but
4076,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah so much of its insane profit driven
4077,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,they're also so much about profit yeah
4078,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4079,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,which is everything honestly like even being a doctor like
4080,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4081,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,you go into work
4082,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's true
4083,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,probably<ts>  at least partially because you're getting paid for it and like
4084,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah<ts>  is a high it's a good paying job
4085,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4086,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but to me it's like a job where it's like good paying but you're doing actually so much good
4087,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4088,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,every day
4089,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,hopefully hopefully
4090,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah<ts>  yeah
4091,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's the goal
4092,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i mean my dad l my dad's like<ts>  amazingly weirdly smart
4093,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,uh huh
4094,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,he's like a history major
4095,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4096,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and is doing things with science somehow
4097,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah that's amazing
4098,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that make no sense to me so
4099,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's really cool wow
4100,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,he probably gets he gets a kick out of that part of it
4101,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah i'm sure
4102,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4103,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i mean i guess it's something good to look forward to that even though like we're academic our academic career kind of is ending soon like we're still gonna to be learning and changing and
4104,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,which is weird yeah<ts>  yeah i just wanna yeah i don't really want that to stop
4105,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,get into different fields
4106,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4107,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah yeah yeah like um two summers ago i worked at a coffee shop in san francisco um
4108,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's chill
4109,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i was really chi actually no it wasn't very chill like it was
4110,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4111,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,um a very strict coffee shop like i had to wear a tie to work and
4112,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,oh really in san francisco
4113,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i actually<ts>  yeah<ts>  and i actually got fired on like my last week which is like a whole nother complicated story but um like i would get anxious and stressed out and like unhappy because i wasn't like thinking and like<ts>  expanding my horizons and using my brain and
4114,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah<ts>  yeah
4115,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i like think that i need to have a certain baseline level of like academic stress at all times or else i like have all this stress ya
4116,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah that's that's why i want to do consulting yeah<ts>  it's like the closest thing i can think of to college
4117,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4118,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,without still being a college
4119,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4120,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah even if it's just perpetual finals period forever
4121,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,fair
4122,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4123,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,at least you'll like be in it together i assume like will you be working on a team like all consulting together as a team
4124,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah<ts>  oh yeah and it's great because it's gonna be all kids my age too
4125,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's really awesome
4126,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,for at least who i come in with
4127,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah yeah
4128,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4129,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,so do they do like some sort of rotational program to get you on track to know how to consult or how does that work
4130,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,they'll probably just throw me on a project
4131,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,wow
4132,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and that's actually that's what i did this summer
4133,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,okay
4134,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and yeah this summer was actually uh i worked at place called cap gemini in dc
4135,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,oh okay i think i've heard of that
4136,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and i had never heard of it but apparently it's like two hundred thousand people and i was like eh
4137,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,nice
4138,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i was i don't even know how i got it actually i don't remember<ts>  but
4139,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i'm sure you worked hard to get it
4140,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah<ts>  but it was just pretty much i they gave us a project where it's like a we work for the government and it said find a government agency and fix it
4141,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,okay<ts>  wow
4142,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,or fix a problem they have yeah
4143,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,okay i'm sure there's a lot of those
4144,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and<ts>  actually i wa i ended up working for the biotechnology regulatory service
4145,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,oh cool
4146,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,so i worked with bio stuff
4147,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,nice nice
4148,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4149,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,wow how do you like it
4150,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,it was first i i worked on a team with the a girl named jing who was out of her mind brilliant but didn't speak any english
4151,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm
4152,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and i worked with a teammate named john who worked remotely in indianapolis
4153,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm<ts>  hm<ts>  oh wow
4154,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,so we were and i was project leader so at first we were incredibly discombobulated
4155,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,wow<ts>  yeah
4156,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,because none of us could communicate in the same area
4157,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's nuts
4158,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but just through skype happy hours jing was a homie so i sat next to jing every day
4159,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,uh huh
4160,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and we had a good time
4161,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's nice
4162,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but eventually i i we were looking up everything on the websites for this
4163,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm
4164,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and it was all saying the opposite shit for everything
4165,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,okay
4166,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,so i just started calling like the emergency hotline number at brs and i was like hey there's no emergency but i really need to speak to someone
4167,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's crazy and did they connect you with someone
4168,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah<ts>  and it<ts>  eventually they put me in touch with this guy named doctor able who i talked to like every day
4169,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,okay
4170,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,about what was i told him i'm like oh i'm a student at tufts i'm just really interested in it
4171,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,okay<ts>  oh my gosh do the did they know that you were consulting and fixing your problems
4172,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,no
4173,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,their problems that's really interesting
4174,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i felt really bad about that
4175,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's really int so how are you allowed to do that or like who hired you how does that work
4176,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,well eventually that we put together this entire huge presentation on it was pretty much whenever let's say monsanto who's a uh
4177,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4178,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4179,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4180,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,so let's say they want to change a plant
4181,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm
4182,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and make it drought resistant
4183,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,uh huh
4184,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,then they're gonna try to augment it in some way with a new phenotype or some type of genetic enhancing
4185,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm<ts>  mhm
4186,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but whenever they go out and experiment it with in the open brs is gonna go and test everything they're doing to make sure it's not harming the environment
4187,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,okay
4188,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,the only thing is they might be like thirty thousand sites across the us and brs incites them randomly
4189,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm<ts>  okay
4190,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,which doesn't make much sense
4191,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4192,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,so i was saying you know if we just have i got all this data and i created all these models that say
4193,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm<ts>  uh huh
4194,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,pretty much there are more uh focused ways we can do this based on risk
4195,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm
4196,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and you can go for certain different plant types that you know are more risky
4197,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,hm<ts>  huh
4198,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and then eliminate half the agency's costs and make it way more efficient and actually purposeful to help
4199,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,cool
4200,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,a the environment
4201,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4202,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,so then we just kinda package this and we gave it to uh i think we may have sent it back to doctor able but i left for that part
4203,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,wow<ts>  wow so do you think they're gonna implement it
4204,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i hope so it makes a ton of sense
4205,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,it does
4206,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4207,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4208,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,after going out to the real world i realized like so many things are unecessarily shitty or like extremely poorly run
4209,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i agree i agree yeah
4210,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and it's just like aw
4211,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and like way too complicated
4212,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,man<ts>  yeah
4213,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and also like i have a theory that no one actually knows what they're doing
4214,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i think that's pretty accurate
4215,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,like how do you learn what you're doing i don't know it's just ya i yeah
4216,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah i have this increasing view that it's pretty much like children almost never grow up
4217,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm
4218,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but we just get bigger and to try to like run the world pretty much
4219,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,right<ts>  right right and have to be leaders but like
4220,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but<ts>  yeah
4221,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,are we even qualified for that
4222,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,am yeah so much of it doesn't make so much of finance or even consulting is jargon to confuse laymen to think what we're doing is really smart
4223,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm hm<ts>  same thing with medicine<ts>  yep
4224,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah and a lot of times it's just common sense or just like
4225,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm
4226,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,make a model
4227,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4228,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and figure it out
4229,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4230,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4231,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but it works
4232,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah i guess it does work
4233,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i mean
4234,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4235,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's really neat
4236,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,medicine i think is so cool
4237,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i also think it's so cool
4238,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4239,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i love it um i'm very excited to learn more
4240,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,do you know what you would be doing yet
4241,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,well i'm going through like phases so like six months ago i was like i'm gonna be an ear nose throat doctor like that's just it that's definitely it um but right now i'm really into gi stuff so like gastro intestinal i think that's really neat
4242,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,hm
4243,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,um i think the colon is like the coolest part of the body<ts>  um yeah all of my friends always make fun of me like abby says the colon is cool like we should make a poster but
4244,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,sure<ts>  could've been a colon for halloween that would've been pretty tight
4245,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i should've been oh my god
4246,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that would've been pretty tight<ts>  yeah
4247,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i was actually um sansa stark from game of thrones though if you watch that we had a great group costume
4248,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,oh nice
4249,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,um yeah so that's kind of the plan right now i don't know i want to do colonoscopies and like endoscopies and
4250,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4251,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,like fix people's stomach issues
4252,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,you should have someone nice doing a colonoscopy we need like more probably like the nicest of possible doctors doing colonoscopies
4253,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah right
4254,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4255,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah definitely<ts>  yeah i mean it like everyone needs them every ten years or five years if they have an elevated risk and like
4256,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i've yeah my grandpa had colon cancer so i actually think i have to get one for which i'm really not looking forward to much
4257,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mm<ts>  mm
4258,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but yeah
4259,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,it'll be fun
4260,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah no it will be fun
4261,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i mean<ts>  like
4262,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i'll pregame it or something
4263,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i think that's what the anesthesia's for
4264,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,do they give you anesthesia
4265,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah yeah
4266,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's better
4267,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4268,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that'd be a much mor intimate relationship
4269,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's much better<ts>  yeah yeah
4270,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,otherwise yeah
4271,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,although i think some people opt to stay weak and like watch it on the screen which like
4272,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,huh
4273,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,is interesting to see your own insides on a screen i can't even imagine what that would feel like
4274,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,hm<ts>  yeah i'd just be like doc you don't wanna go in there
4275,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah<ts>  yeah it's nuts but anyway uh when you were talking about like do working for the government with the monsanto stuff like my mom does a lot of um she used to do like genetic modification for um meadwestvaco
4276,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,okay
4277,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and they were working on making like more efficient trees
4278,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's really cool
4279,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but<ts>  now she does like kind of the opposite she does water
4280,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah<ts>  make trees less efficient
4281,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,no no no um she's like the government monitoring she has her own water testing business so she's like monitoring construction companies to making sure make sure that they're not
4282,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,hmm
4283,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,like
4284,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's a societally useful useful job
4285,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,polluting water<ts>  yeah it's really cool and it's like her own little up business but
4286,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's really cool
4287,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i was always like raised in this house where we were like really cool with like gmos and like genetic modification and like
4288,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah<ts>  i don't really know i feel like everything is kind of gmo based cause i mean how i feel like it doesn't really matter something genetically modified because nature genetically modifies everything anyway
4289,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's a good view point
4290,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,so the stigmatization against it i don't really understand
4291,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4292,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah i feel like fertilizer that stuff or not fertilizers but uh whatever the chemicals pesticides pesticides i'd be more like
4293,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah pesticides
4294,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,we shouldn't do that
4295,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,right right like i'd rather
4296,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4297,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,genetically modify something to be resistant
4298,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah then have to give it pesticides to make it okay
4299,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4300,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4301,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah i mean i guess it's like really complicated because we don't fully know what everything does to our body at this point
4302,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4303,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,so like i don't know
4304,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,stick with oreos
4305,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,we w yeah we're just<ts>  did you just say stick with oreos
4306,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4307,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,you know they're vegan
4308,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,really
4309,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4310,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,oh maybe i should've had one
4311,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,are you vegan
4312,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,no
4313,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i was considering being vegan on and off for awhile
4314,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,really
4315,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah but i like ice cream too much but now they have vegan ice cream so
4316,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah the problem for me is that the difference between vegan and vegetarian is too hard for me to remember so i don't think i could be a good either of them so there's just no way
4317,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,really you can't remember
4318,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,no so there's just no way i could ever do it it's too complicated
4319,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,oh
4320,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,it'd be like another level of stress
4321,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah that's fair i i was vegan for one week
4322,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,hm
4323,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,freshmen year
4324,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's pretty good
4325,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,maybe it was sophomore year yeah it was pretty good it was it was awesome but i i keep kosher so i already kind of like
4326,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,oh nice
4327,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,have this ho well like kosher style like i'm not a very strict about it but um i already like have these dietary restrictions i feel like i
4328,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,yeah
4329,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,i'm pretty good at understanding other dietary restrictions<ts>  like working on them
4330,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that's pretty good i pretty much make the same thing for dinner every day
4331,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,what is that
4332,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,just like chicken with avocado and like arugula tomatoes mushroom
4333,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,that sounds really good for you
4334,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,it is pretty good but i always make kale or kale in the oven
4335,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mm
4336,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and this summer i actually still have a scar on my stomach because i was i had a when i was trying to figure out what i wanted to do
4337,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm

4339,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm
4340,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and asking them about their lives and what they do
4341,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,four hundred
4342,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,a lot of people like in consulting finance or like john tisch and

4350,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,and immediately asking me questions about like discounted cash flows that i did not even ne really need to know for consulting
4351,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,mhm
4352,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,but i was taking out a kale platter from the oven

4512,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,and the other one was like um there's nothing we can really do but we might as well try
4513,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,it's like a conflicting argument so where did you fall
4514,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,i can't give an opinion it's like a writing about the arguments like just i have to write about which argument is presented better

4888,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,it's very five year old but
4889,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,it's easy and simple and you probably already have it in your closet<ts>  they didn't like that idea<ts>  they all want to go
4890,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,yeah i wonder why
4891,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,they wanna go thrift shopping<ts>  and
4892,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,yeah that's the most yeah go to goodwill
4893,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,no apparently there's one in davis
4894,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,what
4895,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,there's apparently one in davis
4896,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,yes goodwill
4897,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,oh is that actually a good will store
4898,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,oh maybe it's not i thought it was
4899,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,i thought it was just like another thrift store
4900,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,there's like three in davis
4901,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,really<ts>  oh
4902,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,yeah
4903,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,i didn't even know i haven't seen any of them
4904,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,there's like one that's like there's one good one i forget what they're called there's one good one one that's cool but it's like actually expensive
4905,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,isn't that the point like not the point of thrift stores
4906,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,so you don't wanna g<ts>  so it's not it's kind of defeats the purpose i mean it's not like expensive expensive but it's more expensive
4907,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,okay
4908,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,and then there's one that's okay
4909,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,i'll go cheap but frankie really wanted to do hippies<ts>  cause frankie wants to buy a pair of bell bottom jeans i think this will be good reason to do it but i don't think i give off a hippie vibe so
4910,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,eh
4911,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,yeah exactly i don't<ts>  so we'll see what'll happen
4912,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,you could do it
4913,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,another good idea was we could all go as animals because megan and really wanted to be um a lobster with her boyfriend but he's going home for the weekend
4914,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,okay wait okay it takes me a second to think of
4915,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,he<ts>  megan's the tall blonde
4916,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,the n<ts>  i know i just need to like connect names to faces but i got it now
4917,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,okay she um he went home for the weekend so i was like oh let's all the animals cause i have like a good dog outfit and megan could be her lobster and someone was like oh yeah i have a cat outfit and they're like wait megan's like i can't be a lobster and you all be like normal animals
4918,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,no th lobster's cool
4919,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,yeah but then my idea got shot out the window
4920,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,yeah she should yeah she should be a lobster
4921,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,so that was a shame
4922,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,um someone told me i should be a seagull
4923,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,oo that's really creative
4924,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,yeah but that's a lot of effort i need to like

5422,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,but it's a lot of it's a lot of discussion about very abstract abstract topics<ts>  um
5423,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,okay
5424,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,like i mean it i mean i don't want to say the meaning of life<ts>  but like just very um i dunno things you wouldn't normally think about
5425,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,well yeah
5426,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,and it's very for me i'm confused most of the time<ts>  but i think most of us are but i think it's good to take it just to branch out
5427,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,yeah
5428,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,little bit

5433,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,starting at the beginning english one is rough
5434,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,yup<ts>  oh it is
5435,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,yeah cause they don't they grade so hard cause if you get an a you're done

5448,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,i think economics is interesting but our professor is crazy
5449,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,yeah my roommate's in it and
5450,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,oh she yeah

5486,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,just in case<ts>  and i like science too but
5487,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,yeah
5488,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,yeah

5491,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,well cause all my friends are in that are in bio now apparently it's a lot of chem
5492,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,so<ts>  it is
5493,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,that you need to know first
5494,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,oh oh is it bio like f
5495,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,which
5496,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,cause there's bio fourteen and then bio
5497,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,thirteen
5498,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,thirteen<ts>  i think i'm doing fourteen
5499,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,i<ts>  okay i i don't know which one it is

5501,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,but
5502,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,i think it's bio thirteen but that would make sense
5503,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,okay<ts>  yeah
5504,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,i don't really like chemistry so
5505,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,yeah that's why i was not really sure
5506,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,i like biology
5507,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,yeah<ts>  um i want to take it but i feel like it's gonna be really hard because my school didn't have ap science or anything
5508,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,alright<ts>  oh okay
5509,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,um and our school like our science curriculum was really weird it was like my school was known as like a science school

5511,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,but it was just because we had these massive research projects we had to do that and like that took up half of the year and we didn't cover like the actual subject
5512,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,oh that's funny
5513,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,like<ts>  like i was in bio but like we only probably did half of what like ap bio would've done<ts>  and we just spent time on research projects
5514,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,okay<ts>  wow did y so did you wait so you had no ap science classes then
5515,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,no
5516,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,okay

6322,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,new york schools are pretty weird so like like they take like old high schools which had like thousands of kids and then they break it down by floor and then those are now different schools
6323,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah
6324,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,so
6325,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,huh
6326,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,so it's it's like one floor of a building is a school
6327,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,okay
6328,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,like my c there was like eighty kids in my class in my graduating class
6329,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,huh<ts>  really<ts>  yeah i had half that forty in my c or like forty five<ts>  yeah very small private liberal school in hartford<ts>  um<ts>  and what's yours like six through twelve
6330,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,no it was just high school
6331,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,okay gotcha mine was six through twelve and we had um in the whole school from the sixth grade to twelfth grade two hundred fifty kids so like extremely small
6332,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,and the same guys over and over
6333,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah i mean that was ultimately the problem
6334,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,good bonds at least right
6335,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,with your good friends but then you have people who you don't wanna see around every day but you have classes with them and like you constantly interact with them on a small campus and yeah like by even by the it junior year i was i was really fed up cause i i didn't come in sixth grade i had been there since seventh but yeah people a lot of the people stay from i mean from six to twelve but or from seven to twelve or you know maybe a couple new people come each year but<ts>  yeah it was essentially the same and you just get really sick of people and teachers too
6336,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,they have the same teachers for it
6337,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,teachers who you haven't<ts>  yeah<ts>  cause it's a small faculty with two hundred fifty kids you know you can only afford to pay so many people and
6338,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,have the same teachers for like six years
6339,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,n yeah i mean not every year but you know a teacher you had in ninth grade you might have junior year or a teacher you had in eighth you might have junior year you know just<ts>  yeah which i don't like<ts>  you know and yet people
6340,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,i mean i guess that's good for like application to share right
6341,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah
6342,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,you'll

6391,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,really
6392,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,pretty tired
6393,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah i went to bed<ts>  i should probably give it some um some context i went to bed at nine last night and woke up at nine today um but reason being the night before i pulled an all nighter and like you know the prior nights i had gotten little very little sleep so i literally was not functioning last night couldn't get any work done you know i had chem lab and then right after didn't even eat dinner just you know went to hodgdon like used my swipe on one of the smoothie things to put in my fridge and then went to bed you know slept basically hours i tried to wake up at am to just crank out work but did not happen<ts>  so
6394,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,i hate uh what's it called like having to go to dewick and like waste twenty minutes to like eat a like like that's me spee eat like rushing i can do it in like twenty minutes almost
6395,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah
6396,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,fuck it
6397,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah i feel that<ts>  what's your favorite place to eat on campus
6398,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,i'd say my default is dewick but
6399,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,mm<ts>  do you like hodgdon
6400,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,uh sometimes like if lunch is weird and shit then i'll like i don't i don't eat breakfast or dinner at hodgdon so
6401,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah<ts>  you should try the um the breakfast sandwiches at hodgdon they're pretty good
6402,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,gotcha
6403,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,like when you're on the go at least you know if you have time to eat a full breakfast of course go to dewick but when you're on the run keep that mind
6404,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,gotcha
6405,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah<ts>  i lived um in hill last year do you know where that is probably through mail services right
6406,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,sure
6407,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah and um yeah i i hated hill location was terrible you're on the other side of campus you know<ts>  yet the closest building to this building which goes to show how just far it is from campus
6408,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,i mean at least it's close to the mail right
6409,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,that's the only advantage
6410,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,the the
6411,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,like i could walk out of my room and get mail right away but how much mail do you
6412,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,the fact that like you know like the advantage of getting shit delivered is you don't gotta get up so like you gotta go all the way there's no like purpose
6413,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah true but yeah for me i didn't get that much mail i don't order that much so i maybe got ten packages the whole year maybe fifteen<ts>  if you're getting ten a week
6414,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,like i use i use amazon for like groceries and shit
6415,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,you know
6416,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,like i'm like i don't wanna like

6418,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,and i'm like no i gotta like i might as well fuck go to fucking what is it go to davis or some shit
6419,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah i could see that then for me i i don't order that much only when i need to so that wasn't a big advantage for me and the gym people say hill is closer closer cause you wake down walk you could walk down boston ave um you know but honestly i'm in haskell now and it's not that much farther maybe two minutes
6420,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,i don't really go to the gym
6421,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,further
6422,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,so like
6423,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,i don't anymore really but last year when i did you know yeah not that much so yeah hill hill was terrible didn't really like the people i lived with beside from my roommate maybe a couple other people and

6482,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,i heard these things are like really expensive
6483,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,really
6484,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah the these parts
6485,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,this is what they wear like you know
6486,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,like you know like
6487,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,ted talks and stuff

6489,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,and
6490,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,they're like seven hundred bucks or some shit
6491,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,really
6492,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah
6493,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,shit i mean it is like a small piece
6494,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,i wonder if they have like different like colors for races
6495,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,so it makes sense
6496,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,like black people get darker
6497,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,oh they have to yeah i'm sure they do<ts>  or at least just black and white you know<ts>  but
6498,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,hm

6500,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,didn't why don't give like descriptions of what you're gonna do beforehand
6501,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah
6502,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,like
6503,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,i kinda
6504,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,like i have like what if they're gonna strap like shit to my head like i don't know
6505,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah
6506,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,for the like brain shit i don't know<ts>  but<ts>  hm
6507,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,um<ts>  yeah you have any ideas what to talk about
6508,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,the shape of the table's kind of weird
6509,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,forms a pentagon
6510,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,hexagon
6511,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,hexagon
6512,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah
6513,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah oh i'm out of it
6514,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,hm
6515,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,they have it like perfectly aligned<ts>  it's kinda weird like aside from seeing each other it looks like it's a mirror
6516,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah
6517,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,almost you know
6518,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,hm
6519,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,although you
6520,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,what what could be the purpose of this
6521,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah it literally is the same<ts>  yeah wait a minute<ts>  it's like the same um<ts>  set up<ts>  literally like look at the yellow
6522,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,and then they they separate our our voices right so it's like we're hearing our selves like we're talking to a mirror i'm like oh my god
6523,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,yeah it's actually yeah look at the yellow under the at the bottom of the camera they have that on both sides
6524,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,the fuck
6525,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,it honestly is like it's a whole
6526,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,let's see if the let's see if they made any mistakes there's one unplugged i think<ts>  yeah mine's wrapped yours isn't wrapped<ts>  like see th yours is on the floor
6527,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,where
6528,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,mines is wrapped up there
6529,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,oh yeah<ts>  so now we know it's not a mirror
6530,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,or maybe it's a game like we have to find the l oh look my thing's different<ts>  for the for the
6531,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,it is<ts>  it's pointed that
6532,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,it is a game
6533,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,i actually for a second thought like wait is there way they made like every thing a mirror
6534,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,hm
6535,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,except us like look at the table it's like perfect you know everything is perfect except<ts>  but no yeah you're right there are differences
6536,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,or maybe he just fucked up when he was setting it up
6537,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,they clearly tried to make it perfect though
6538,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,i mean they're not i mean the they're like pretty far apart too and these are pretty close
6539,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,i mean like it<ts>  true yeah that's another thing
6540,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,hm
6541,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,i wonder what that yeah what that yellow thing is to trip you up clearly
6542,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,exact
6543,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,cause what else would that be there for
6544,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,you have like a little edge<ts>  mine don mine doesn't have a ledge like next to the door
6545,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,oh yeah yeah you're right

6838,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,wait how far were you from your high school where you had to use the highway
6839,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,it was a twenty minute drive we used to take the train
6840,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,really
6841,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah
6842,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,oh damn
6843,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,um in freshman sophomore and part of junior year i would take the train every single day
6844,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,mhm
6845,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,um<ts>  and yeah it w like that was like a that was like a twenty minute train ride um and then once like everyone got like cars they could drive and got a license um we started car pooling and stuff
6846,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,mhm
6847,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,but by by the of it i started driving myself cause it was really relaxing to be able to like listen to my own music
6848,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah
6849,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,and everything on the highway
6850,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,that's true<ts>  yeah i know mine was like a five minute drive but um yeah i would just like have my mom drive me um and then like when i got my license i would like drive myself
6851,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah my my parents never drove me cause my dad was busy and my mom doesn't drive on highways

6853,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,so that and that was the only thing that worked
6854,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah
6855,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,i m so
6856,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah
6857,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,uh yeah i had like the a car that was like designated for like me and my brother even though anyone in the family would drive it
6858,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,mhm

6860,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah
6861,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,and like in the summer it was like senior year it was like the summer after senior year so i was doing like the most driving and i was going to like the most places i'd ever like gone to before so it was like it was really annoying where i'd be like oh yeah i'm trying to go to like this friend's house this afternoon my mom's like na he my brother your brother took it to football

6865,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,that's annoying
6866,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,and i was like ugh yeah
6867,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,i don't know now now like most of my friends just drive<ts>  it's it's fine
6868,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah and like i had a i had a lot of friends who like had their own cars so they were just drive me places
6869,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah i feel like most people in new york don't really drive around though most of the people i've talked to haven't really like gotten their licenses
6870,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,it it depends where you're from like from the city like there's no point if you're from the city there's really no point in getting your license<ts>  cause you're not gonna drive in the city but like long island like
6871,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah<ts>  but like it's good to have your license
6872,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah
6873,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,sooner rather than later
6874,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah like everyone in long island has their license
6875,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah driving w driving on like the highways is like definitely like one of my favorite things to do
6876,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah yeah
6877,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,and like in california there's this one highway where it's it like runs all it's sort of like runs through these like hills and it's really beautiful
6878,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,mhm
6879,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,and there's like fog rolling over them and everything so it's just like a really cool place to drive in
6880,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah
6881,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,like you can go really fast there cause there's like there's no cars
6882,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah
6883,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,and also there's no cops so you can go like way faster and they don't really care<ts>  um so i would drive like eighty fi eighty eighty five just like constantly<ts>  to get to places
6884,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah yeah yeah i know it's definitely rela relaxing but like the only time i would really go on the highway is like driving from like driving to and from work i would use the highway and then like if i would just go to jersey with my parents i would drive on the highway
6885,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,you'd do the driving for that
6886,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah<ts>  well i would drive home cause usually like my dad would be like oh i'm going there we'd have like we have to be there by a certain time so i'll drive but it's like stressful at night
6887,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,oh definitely
6888,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,like cause it
6889,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,night driving on the highway with a lot of cars around is really stressful
6890,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah<ts>  it's like it would always like make me really anxious and it would take me like half an hour until like i got the hang of it
6891,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah
6892,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah<ts>  but like usually i would just drive on local roads cause i never really like needed the highway
6893,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,we w<ts>  that's fair we would drive up to we drive up to lake taho whole lot
6894,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,mhm
6895,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,and the dri like the first half is just like long boring highway driving
6896,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah
6897,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,but the second half is like really windy like two lane highways with a lot of like giant trucks and it's like really sketchy
6898,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,mhm
6899,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,like you've got a wall on one side and like a cliff on the other it's like really freaky
6900,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah
6901,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,and um like i i learned how to do that driving eventually and it was it's you need to be like focused and locked in like twenty four seven
6902,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah
6903,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,when you're doing that
6904,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,and like i just like i tend to like zone out when i'm driving and either like i like pay attention to music or i'll just like relax too much
6905,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah i can't do that
6906,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,so like highway driving like i'm like i need to pay attention to everything happening
6907,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,mhm and when you're doing it at night you like get you get drowsy
6908,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah yeah yeah exactly<ts>  so like my dad like he like n he never really let me drive on the highway unless he was with me or if my mom was with me but like i wouldn't be allowed to drive on the highway by myself
6909,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,i think the dmv called it like highway hypnosis or something like that i don't even know i don't even know why i still remember that
6910,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,that makes<ts>  that makes sense that makes a lot of sense yeah i like don't understand how people iike still don't have their license like i literally got mine like the week after i turned sixteen

6945,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,nine<ts>  that's harsh
6946,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,by yourself well you yeah you can drive but also like that's like just long island like new york city's so much more restrictive
6947,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,i i mean i can imagine
6948,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah
6949,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,it's crazy there
6950,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,and then like when you're eighteen you get your
6951,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,it's like mostly taxis

7076,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah<ts>  yeah like i like nine thirty was like earlier than i because i wanted to at ten thirty
7077,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,i'm starting at ten thirty every single day
7078,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,i wish like mondays i at one thirty
7079,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,really
7080,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah
7081,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,i'd take like i'd take a nine thirty as opposed to a ten thirty if it meant i could sleep until one thirty on like tuesdays or something
7082,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah it's it's nice cause like mondays i late and then fridays i early and like it's hard like waking up at nine thirty but like it's m it's not like eight thirty like it's manageable still

7086,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,yeah i like normally like on fridays i would probably like wake up at ten thirty anyway so the fact that i'm done by ten twenty like it's it's so manageable
7087,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,i mean i w i sleep till noon on fridays i don't know about you but
7088,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,i just i've already come back from spanish and i get breakfast and then i go back to bed and then i wake up at like noon
7089,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,that sounds perfect

7127,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,but yeah<ts>  it's not that like the material is all that difficult but it's a lot of like you know figuring out what it's all about like mutations so like they'll give you a pathway and they'll say like alright if i break this receptor what happens
7128,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,uh huh
7129,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,if now i you know change and i mix two different kinds of receptors what's gonna happen then<ts>  <ts>  so it's all like
7130,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,apply
7131,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7132,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,all this stuff
7133,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,exactly
7134,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7135,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7136,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,that's kinda hard<ts>  dang and what what day is that one on
7137,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,thur wednesday it's a wednesday thursday

7147,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,but
7148,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,like total
7149,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,on the team we have fourteen
7150,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh wow
7151,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah yeah but i think that in the competitions and stuff twelve are allowed to dance
7152,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7153,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so um we kind of do like rotation
7154,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm
7155,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,but um but yeah yeah fourteen on the team
7156,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,wait competition not like a perform like they're literal
7157,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah yeah<ts>  so like the one on one one here is a competition
7158,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh interesting
7159,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,but then like when we go to um other places like it's um not really a it's a it's like it's a competition so you'd have to like um actually you'd be you're be judged on how you dance and like scored and stuff so
7160,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,woah that's kinda crazy
7161,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and it's like teams from and it's not just y collegiate teams you can be against it's like um collegiate teams professional teams there are literally people who do this for a living
7162,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah yeah
7163,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,because like you have all these like punjabi centers like for for like you know you have like indian cultural centers
7164,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7165,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,the people who run that and then just form bhangra teams through that
7166,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,uh huh
7167,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so
7168,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,uh huh<ts>  wow that's kinda crazy and there are like judges who just know
7169,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7170,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,whoa
7171,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7172,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,that's kind of crazy so are and you're dancing or you're performing like this coming performance<ts>  it's not your turn to sit out
7173,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,uh<ts>  i so there are two actually there's one on friday and one on saturday so i think
7174,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh so everyone will get
7175,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah so w i will sit out one and then my my friend who i'm switching out with will do the other
7176,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,gotcha<ts>  wait how many freshmen are on the team
7177,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,uh<ts>  se seven
7178,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh so it's mostly
7179,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,e<ts>  no no no no no so so well seven newbies two of them are sophomores though
7180,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh<ts>  okay
7181,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so s five freshmen
7182,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh gotcha gotcha do they still get more rank than you<ts>  or
7183,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,no w we're i think we're about all about the same like because if you think about it like each year the segment changes<ts>  so like um you know what we the dances we do the moves we do each year it changes so like even if you're a returner the only advantage you have over someone else is like the expertise in the moves
7184,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7185,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,compared to the newbies but we're all learning relearning or like we're learning together so what's new for me it's new
7186,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah<ts>  oh oh oh like what the new choreography
7187,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7188,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and everything
7189,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,the new choreo so what they do is like a banghra is made divided into segments
7190,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm
7191,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so like you will have you know a slow segment you will have um and then all the other fast segments two of them are like props so you you have props that you use you'll see when you um w i w if you watch the performance
7192,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm
7193,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,um and then so that's one<ts>  that's three<ts>  and then
7194,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,like the like this thing
7195,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,that
7196,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7197,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and then we also have like these giant like pvc pipe like we we use pvc pipe but th they're like they're sticks
7198,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7199,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and you know you dance and it's like s just supposed to add color and loudness to the performance
7200,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah yeah
7201,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,right<ts>  and so<ts>  um yeah so that so apart from the slow segment and those two the other you can figure out how many ever you want a typical dance is like eight eight minutes long so to fit that time you can decide and usually it's based around a single type of move so like you know the each segment is named after a different kind of move so like this move is called dhammal and you know you can build a second around that
7202,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7203,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and so you know e like we keep one or two segments from year to year so that we can actually like because we also have one or two performance in the first semester<ts>  right so we can't just re learn a h completely new thing in the first month
7204,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm<ts>  yeah yeah
7205,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so the um all the returners will usually dance the first fully using the previous year's set and the newbies will learn like one or two segments from it
7206,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm
7207,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,e you know time permitting and so um we l f for first two performances we learned like two of the segments
7208,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7209,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and then after that everything else was new so us and the new uh the returners were on the same page yeah so um it's not it's like the what where the returners have like the advantage<ts>  it was like something floating around<ts>  um where the returners have like the advantage is that um they've learned how to do the moves
7210,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,it's alright<ts>  yeah
7211,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and they've seen many of the same moves there's only so many moves you can do
7212,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,right right right
7213,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,just in different combinations
7214,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,right<ts>  yep
7215,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so they've all they've seen all the moves they know how to do all the moves for them it's just remembering the choreo<ts>  for us it's not only remembering the choreo but like figuring out how do the moves
7216,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah right<ts>  it's like basketball
7217,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7218,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,like you know a screen roll<ts>  but where does it yeah
7219,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7220,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,that's interesting wait how many times do you have to meet a week every
7221,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,we do so last semester we did two times a week for two hours so four hours total
7222,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,okay<ts>  did you do you get a credit for it or no
7223,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,no it's a club
7224,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,it's just just an extracurricular
7225,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,it's a club yeah
7226,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,gotcha
7227,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah so it's uh but i guess the nice thing is they try to keep most practices on like the weekends<ts>  we have one like on a tuesday
7228,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mm
7229,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,which kinda sucks
7230,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7231,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,but it's also like from ten to midnight
7232,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7233,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so it's like y you're not gonna get anything done then
7234,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah yeah right right
7235,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so<ts>  especially if you have class the next day
7236,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and then it amps up like now when the performance is
7237,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah now we have three
7238,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah

7271,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so i never ended up doing it
7272,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm mhm
7273,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,it's m more usually for like this team is all girls but guys do do it
7274,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm<ts>  yeah
7275,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and then the fourth team is the bollywood fusion team s t uh so tamasha
7276,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,gotcha
7277,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah and they the sad thing about them is like most schools have pretty stocked bollywood dance teams and like some of the dances and stuff they got like bc has a really really good bollywood fusion team
7278,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm
7279,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,um and the thing about bollywood fusion it's supposed to combine many different styles so but th what they'll do is they'll dance to like contemporary folk music and they'll come up with some really really cool moves and then they also have a banghra segment usually at the
7280,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh woah
7281,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,because banghra's supposed to be so hype they want to close it out<ts>  and they do like the most hype moves
7282,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah yeah yeah<ts>  yeah
7283,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,from banghra sets and then they close it out
7284,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,wow
7285,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,um and then yeah but the thing is our team like is all girls and there's only they only have like six people six or seven people for some reason i don't know why but yeah and then so each of us will do our dances and then like all the freshmen will do the dance and sophomores will do the dance and senior juniors seniors
7286,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh gotcha wow that's a th that's a long show<ts>  holy cow
7287,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7288,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,dang
7289,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,but most other i would say like most other performances are pretty short
7290,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7291,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,like tamasha none of them cross four minutes we're the longest ones just because of the nature of and like the the culture of the dance
7292,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm
7293,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,like it's supposed to be a certain
7294,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm
7295,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,but yeah
7296,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,interesting
7297,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,what are you up to this weekend
7298,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,i just have to study too i have yeah social psych monday psych stats wednesday and then proctor's class
7299,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh
7300,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,the exam on friday
7301,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,i hope you know those take a while right
7302,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh yeah
7303,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7304,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah no i i have
7305,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,like four hours
7306,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah i ha<ts>  four hours
7307,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,it took me al more uh the first one took me three and a half second one took me five and a half third one took me almost six
7308,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,whoa he said two
7309,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah d i i told you right one thing he's not good about is judging time
7310,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,is estimating<ts>  yeah
7311,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,or amount
7312,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,although maybe he's good oh i guess we're being recorded but maybe he's good at like judging time for you know people at the back of the class you know who who who no but people who maybe are not as like
7313,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah i think that he like the fact that he gives you no upper limit and just kind of like take however long you want so p most people most people are just kind of sit there and and because y think about it right like the how many ever pages your essay was you're regurgitating that
7314,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah it kinda insinuates<ts>  yeah
7315,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,right
7316,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,right and it took me six hours to write that
7317,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and some<ts>  yeah and like i mean of course now you'll have less time because you know obviously i think that he wants you to cut it down
7318,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7319,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,right
7320,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,well and you can't cite
7321,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and you can't
7322,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,that's what takes a lot of time
7323,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah yeah and um and also you're not there's no idea generation
7324,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,you know
7325,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,it's pure regurgitation at this point
7326,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,right right right right
7327,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,you know<ts>  although he expects like you to have thought about it a little bit
7328,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,expand on your
7329,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,eh mm
7330,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7331,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,you know usually it's it's pretty much the same thing
7332,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7333,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and then so you know once you write that essay um you uh you also have like the the side
7334,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,two ids
7335,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,like the id's
7336,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7337,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah<ts>  which are um straight up rote memorization
7338,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7339,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and like at the the final exam you'll have something called a short answer which is even more straight up rote memorization
7340,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm
7341,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so it's like he literally wants you to just know as much detail as possible
7342,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7343,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,the more you know the better
7344,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,that's what he said<ts>  yeah i'll go to the review session i think tonight
7345,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh those help so much
7346,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7347,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,literally you could
7348,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,did you go to two or did you just go to one
7349,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,no they're all the same
7350,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7351,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so e even if you don't go he records them
7352,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,okay that's what he said
7353,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so just if you listen to them
7354,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7355,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and because like what here my strategy is this right
7356,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm
7357,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,very simple to save you the most amount of time you have like i think he says d did he tell you the philosophy with the id's
7358,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah you have six he breaks it up into like six different
7359,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,he breaks it up and he will give you one from each right
7360,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7361,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so don't study all six
7362,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh yeah yeah no
7363,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,study like three yeah
7364,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,i'm he said study three
7365,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7366,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah<ts>  exactly
7367,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and so what you should do is like listen to the first part or if go attend the first part of like the route where he he will break he break has he broken it up already
7368,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mm mm
7369,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,no he'll do it in the review sessions
7370,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7371,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so he breaks up everything just see how it's broken up and then depending how it's broken up you then figure out like
7372,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,which three are the most interesting yeah<ts>  or whatever
7373,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,or i mean i i did
7374,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,easiest
7375,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,y i did the ones with th the least categories
7376,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7377,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,cause you know what he's gonna give you
7378,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,ah yeah
7379,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so that's how you play the game
7380,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,ah that's smart that's smart
7381,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,that's how you play the game
7382,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7383,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,i i feel so bad about it on the inside but hey i just
7384,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,but that's what he said
7385,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7386,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,too<ts>  he literally explained all of that
7387,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,just choose the<ts>  yeah
7388,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,in class he was like
7389,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah proctor that's sort of you're right he wants to make it easy
7390,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,he's pretty transparent yeah
7391,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,pretty uh he there he doesn't hide anything
7392,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7393,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,like he literally is not out there to get you
7394,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,right
7395,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,if you you know if you
7396,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah if you do the work
7397,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,the only people who who pose an obstacle to that often are the ta's
7398,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,then
7399,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,cause the tas grade sometimes a little harshly
7400,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh
7401,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,like there've been situations where he's been like um oh you know this is a great essay he's literally told me in the rec uh has he sent you a recording yet
7402,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,no i ha i haven't had ti i haven't gotten to send it early enough
7403,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,are you in<ts>  okay<ts>  no issues<ts>  but like when i sent when i sent it even if you send it like the day of sometimes it's better cause it's like y you know
7404,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh you can have him over override the
7405,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah<ts>  that that's that's happened four times
7406,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,if he says it's<ts>  yeah yeah
7407,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,like<ts>  and because it's and it's not th of course that's not the reason i do it or anything but it just happens
7408,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,right
7409,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,like for example he will in the recording he will literally say oh this is easily a check plus
7410,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7411,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and then i'll get it back it'll be check plus over check and i'm like woah and then i show it to proctor and then there's been one essay where he made it a check double plus over check plus
7412,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah yeah you told me about that one
7413,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,you know the guy he's a great guy
7414,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7415,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,um but yeah so with the id's like and that's why i was saying like you don't have to do all the reading
7416,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7417,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,because the id's are really what you have to read for you know
7418,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah<ts>  yeah
7419,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,the id's and the essays because if you're not gonna like the rest of it if you want to take it because it's an interesting course don't subject yourself to additional work take it because he like the most interesting part of the course to me was his lecture
7420,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,is just listening to him<ts>  yeah no totally
7421,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,was his lecture yeah that was the real part of the course that sold me you know because like he is such a good lecturer
7422,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7423,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,but the fact of the matter is like all the reading first of all is not it's too conceptual
7424,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7425,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,it's not very detail oriented
7426,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7427,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and the thing is like another issue with him that i had
7428,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,the the ones i do like though are like the primary documents in the rogers or whatever like th those are
7429,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,i barely read those<ts>  i should've i should've read them more
7430,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,what<ts>  th they're kinda interes like we just read the industrial revolution ones
7431,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,but<ts>  yeah
7432,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and it's like interviews of you know workers
7433,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7434,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,who worked like whatever they wee like eighteen hour days
7435,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,right<ts>  yeah
7436,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and
7437,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,it's also but you also gotta keep in mind like the perspective like you and mishko are more like econ ir type people right
7438,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah right right
7439,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,now i'm a science guy
7440,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7441,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so for me to like go in and it wasn't it's not as you know
7442,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh yeah yeah it just
7443,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,really i've loved grown up loving history but after coming to college i realized like there are degrees
7444,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mm
7445,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,there are real degrees to th there are people who enjoy these readings
7446,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7447,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,i just you know for me listening to lecture watching videos like learning about the topics for fun is great
7448,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm
7449,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,but like just the amount of dense reading for a topic y y you know it just it takes away the value for me
7450,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah<ts>  yeah no i agree the secondary when it's like people talking about it i'd rather just listen to proctor
7451,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah<ts>  yeah no honestly and i think you should do that with the the r the thing is that for some topics um especially the french revolution the he like palmer and cotin are specialists
7452,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mm
7453,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,in um the french revolution
7454,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so it's worth reading
7455,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so it's worth reading that
7456,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,although we didn't get cause we had the second edition of palmer so i didn't have any of his
7457,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh so you didn't
7458,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,i had like a brief gloss over eighteen fifteen or whatever
7459,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,okay
7460,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and they like talked about a little of what happened before
7461,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so did he did he did he not spend time much time on the enlightenment and the french revolution
7462,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,no no he did but the reading just didn't cover that
7463,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,i see
7464,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,cause you know it was the textbook before
7465,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah<ts>  so what do he make you read for that just rogers
7466,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah a lot of ro and then there was a like a little bit of homer
7467,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,a little blurb
7468,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and then and then he picked out some things from like winserster
7469,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,okay<ts>  okay
7470,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and s just outside sources
7471,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7472,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,that he brought in
7473,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,makes that makes sense yeah cause he loves the french revolution
7474,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7475,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and there's honestly a lot of reading especially with that and that's what made it harder but like honestly like some of those readings are much more interesting than um but for like topics i th i don't know how it is for the second edition but for like many of the topics like medieval europe unnecessary amount of you know like regurgitating
7476,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm<ts>  dense<ts>  y y yeah
7477,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,the same thing<ts>  yeah just dense you know like talking my medieval life and all that
7478,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7479,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,like<ts>  he talked about like education women and all that and that was great but you know i like honestly the period i that i focused least on was medieval
7480,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7481,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,you know cause uh keep in mind that for the first half of the course um b it's all byzantine empire
7482,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7483,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,right so i like the first i would say even like up to the third exam i made sure to include at least one or two things about the byzantine empire the first exam is all byzantine empire
7484,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm
7485,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,but like the second exam was about half and i made sure to like focus on the byzantine empire cause that that was just much more modular and and for that the textbook doesn't go into much detail
7486,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm
7487,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so the really the reading's not worth it but like for many of the other european stuff they go into a lot of detail
7488,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah yeah
7489,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and you kinda just have to you know feel for w what's worth reading and what's not but honestly like you will see what i mean when like for the second exam don't go crazy as much with the readings
7490,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7491,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,like
7492,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,no i i'm already understand like i thought that when when he said id's at the beginning of the semester i just have like high school in mind
7493,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh
7494,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,where you you know you write like a paragraph but there's like fifteen id's
7495,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7496,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and you just have to know them<ts>  you know
7497,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,right
7498,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,but this is like before the exam you can just see exactly what you're supposed to study
7499,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,you can exactly
7500,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and just study that
7501,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,exactly yeah and literally you can isola you can bring it down to and many times the review session it gets even funnier cause he will give you like he will tell you oh you know this one i really really like this one
7502,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah<ts>  yeah oh no i know i know i know
7503,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,i really really like this one<ts>  this one
7504,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,he he starred certain ones
7505,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,this one is this one is ve
7506,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,the crimean war
7507,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah<ts>  yeah
7508,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,you should probably study that one
7509,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah<ts>  yeah and then and then he's like this one will very likely show up on the exam
7510,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7511,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,somes he's like this will definitely be on the exam so
7512,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah yeah
7513,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,you can know right then and there and if they fit in your category so much better you know like that is one of them gonna be there
7514,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7515,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and here's another thing
7516,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and there's only two and he said that he was a softy like he said it would be two out of six but it's like two out of like ten or whatever
7517,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah he ends up giving you like the final exam he was like oh you know i'll give you uh we'll we'll give you nine categories this time there were eighteen
7518,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah<ts>  cause he's just interested in everything so he just i don't know
7519,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah he just wants to make it easy for you
7520,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7521,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,that's the best part like he literally i didn't i didn't realize like i thought oh when i when i took his class i was like oh maybe all professors are like as but he's like a leaps and beyon leaps and bounds above everybody else
7522,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7523,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,he just cause he like goes out of his way to make sure that you guys are taken care of the amount of extra credit he gives is just insane
7524,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah that is preposterous i know movies if you write all the essays you get extra credit what
7525,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,it's literally he's like saying like uh if you do what you're supposed to do in college you i'll give you extra credit
7526,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah i know
7527,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,if you do less than you're supposed to you will get full credit
7528,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah you'll be fine yeah i know<ts>  i went and talked to him too about my essay length cause i've like y you're right i routinely write like six or seven pages for like a two page minimum prompt but he said yeah at the so what he he put it he said this he said that like at the of the semester the number grade you have is the minimum grade you can have
7529,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,it happens
7530,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and then he'll adjust it to where he sees you've put the effort in
7531,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7532,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,which kind of makes sense so i guess it makes it worth it too
7533,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7534,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,especially cause all of those essays just come right back on the exam
7535,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,right but just if you if you just think about like even if you get all check pluses over checks in all your essays first will only count for very little
7536,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah it's ten percent
7537,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and then with the amount of extra credit you get like it's like i pretty sure some people had like a hundred and twelve average
7538,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah yeah right
7539,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so
7540,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah no i'm not worried<ts>  it's an interesting class too
7541,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,it's an interesting class
7542,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,he loves it
7543,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,i wanted to take the second half
7544,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7545,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,but
7546,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,i honestly
7547,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,just the like the enlightenment and the french revolution industrial revolution like it's all very interesting and stuff but i just find it so much there's so much material so many people to learn so many people to think about
7548,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,he's moved through it relatively quickly
7549,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,it makes sense cause that was all the previous previous class
7550,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7551,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,he he has to<ts>  because now you know probably indus the industrial revolution is probably new though
7552,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah<ts>  yeah<ts>  yeah
7553,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and uh vienna
7554,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7555,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,is new as well
7556,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah we did that we did that pretty quickly but then industrial revolution we spent a while on and then yeah i i'm looking i wa i want like bismarck up through world war one
7557,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh that's gonna be really interesting
7558,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah that's my fav when we took that in high school that was my favorite
7559,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7560,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,what are you
7561,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,no i uh there's a hindu thing where you s if you step on something you're supposed to like touch it
7562,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh gotcha gotcha
7563,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so i stepped on a wire
7564,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh
7565,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,but anyway<ts>  i didn't realize there was a wire
7566,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah no it kind of feels like one of us is in jail you know
7567,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
7568,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,you know you know this and like you're
7569,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,it's like yeah you're talking for the

7575,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7576,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,this is g it's weird to think of someone like listening to this recording
7577,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7578,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,like hello to everybody who's listening
7579,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,the camera's behind you
7580,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh yeah hello oh what oh th isn't it
7581,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah it's same thing here
7582,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh yeah
7583,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,right yep
7584,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,isn't it like that have you seen that thing in psych where um what happened oh no you wouldn't have seen it but if so say you have a camera over there right and a camera over there whoever watches this feed will feel like you dominated the conversation more than i did
7585,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh oh really
7586,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,because they see your face
7587,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh
7588,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah<ts>  and then
7589,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,got it okay
7590,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,isn't that interesting
7591,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah but i fu
7592,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,and then people who sit right there
7593,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,will have a ba
7594,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,think it's equal
7595,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7596,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,isn't that weird
7597,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah it's an interesting design that they have it like the because it at this point there's no like you can't watch unless there's a camera like above or something you can't l really watch the conversations
7598,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah the whole
7599,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,but you can watch it from one
7600,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah right<ts>  yeah it is interesting
7601,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mm
7602,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,i don't know maybe that's part of it<ts>  it might be it might be i don't know it have you read blink by malcolm gladwell it's like thin slicing but he he there's like thin slicing is basically like the stuff you pick up on in the first like second of seeing something
7603,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm<ts>  mhm
7604,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so like i think he opens the book with there's like this um this statue that's supposedly this ancient like incredibly valuable statue and this museum buys it like they did tests on the rock to make sure it was the right kind of um material and everything and it's from some ancient civilization and then they bring in an expert and like ten experts come in and the first time they see it they're like it's fake and they're like uh it better not be fake we paid like twenty million and so they keep doing tests and they're like oh no it's real and then like ten years later they found out that it was actually a fake<ts>  but but like certain p like people just it talks about like the importance of like trusting your first instinct
7605,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah<ts>  yeah
7606,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,wait i forget where i was going with this but
7607,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,this is interesting though
7608,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7609,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,a lot of it was like is it
7610,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oh but in conversation like um if you if you look at oj mayo's wait is that yeah oj mayo's trial wait is that his last name
7611,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oj mayo oj simpson you mean

7613,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,what the fuck
7614,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,oj simpson's trial oj mayo is a basketball player<ts>  if you look at his trial like he has these certain like facial like twitches right before he says stuff that like show that he's guilty or whatever
7615,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7616,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,i don't know

7802,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm
7803,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,but
7804,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah yeah no for sure understand how yeah but my friend who is pre med i think wants to do bio psych now
7805,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,cool
7806,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,w which i think for a doctor would make sense too
7807,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,makes sense
7808,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,sort of
7809,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah i just i d i don't know how i feel but i want to because the thing is i want to keep like the option open of not going pre med
7810,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,right
7811,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,if i don't want to
7812,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,right
7813,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so i'm considering not you know like i that's why i didn't necessarily go the full bio psych route
7814,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,mhm
7815,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,cause then i would be locked in
7816,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7817,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,i wanted to have like a viable second option
7818,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7819,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,so i've been thinking about biotech

7821,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,there's a there's a second major called biotech here
7822,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,yeah
7823,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,where you can basically take courses in biotechnology if you like and um i think i might up doing that

8367,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah that's c<ts>  do you get paid or is it volunteer
8368,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,it's volunteer but you get like free tee shirts and backpacks and hats and stuff<ts>  that all say tufts on them
8369,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,wow i didn't know that
8370,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,and they're all like nike
8371,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,interesting
8372,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so it's pretty cool
8373,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so you just like show up to school a few days earlier
8374,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8375,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah that's pretty good
8376,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,mhm<ts>  you have like four days of training where it's like
8377,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,training
8378,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah like um i don't really know how to describe it's just like a bunch of like talks with different like teams at tufts and like the oeo
8379,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,oh
8380,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,um
8381,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,cause oeo is like training right
8382,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8383,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,oh
8384,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,um just so that you can be like a better resource for the kids so like if they ask you questions about classes that you haven't taken or like distribution requirements you kind of know how everything's broken up
8385,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,nice<ts>  yeah
8386,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,and then it's like four days or five days with the kids um
8387,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,what is like a fit what's like a typical day of fit like what would you do
8388,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,like it's super busy like we try to keep it super busy because in the past a lot of the kids would like drink in their free time
8389,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,i'm curious<ts>  oh really
8390,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8391,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,wow
8392,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so like the program tries to make it so that the kids are like always occupied and not like doing stuff that they don't want them to be doing
8393,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,it's a good idea yeah
8394,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,um so it's like you wake up you have breakfast and then usually there's like talks either from like tufts athletics or tufts deans or different um groups on campus kind of
8395,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,nice
8396,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,introducing them to all the different um options that they'll have like of things to get involved in<ts>  and then it's usually lunch and then some type of outdoor activity um and they have the option to either do yoga or swimming or like kick ball
8397,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,oh yeah i always s i saw all the kids like carry like yoga mats

8399,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,and stuff
8400,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8401,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,all the time
8402,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,exactly<ts>  and then at night um like each day something different but one night we like all go out into boston
8403,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,i heard there was like a cruise
8404,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,uh
8405,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,right
8406,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah the last day we have the fit cruise and we all go to like back bay in boston and they have like this big like cruise ship it's kind of just like a boat with a dance floor and like everyone just like hangs out um<ts>  and then another night we go bowling um and then another thing we did this year was we all um like in our groups had this scavenger hunt around campus and there were like all these different activities that had to do with different locations on campus so people kinda learned their way around
8407,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,interesting<ts>  uh huh

8412,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,but the like peer leaders weren't involved<ts>  so then they would kinda just watch and then it was kind of awkward for the freshmen<ts>  um but this year we were also involved so like me and my coleader like wanted our group to do really well so we were kind of a lot more competitive and then all the groups kind of got into a lot more cause like we were actually engaged in it too and wanted to win
8413,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,oh
8414,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so

8545,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8546,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah so when we have an erg test like we'll either have like a k or like a k it's like
8547,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,oh yeah
8548,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,if you did track and like were running a mile or something timed um so the coxens like all bring their laptops and then after they're done we have to go around and like record all information about like what their stroke rating was which is like how many strokes you take in a minute
8549,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,oh wow
8550,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,and like what their final time was and like what all our average splits were
8551,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so you do have to do that too
8552,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,no so like for that we just like kind of motivate them as they're doing it and then like go around and take down their times
8553,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,oh
8554,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so like our coach he like thinks it's cool if the coxens do the workouts when we're off the water<ts>  so like i usually do up doing them just because like i ran in high school so i'm like fit enough to do them<ts>  um
8555,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,but wait but it's like ho what does running have to do with that
8556,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,well i'm just like aerobically fit<ts>  like i don't do well compared to them but it's just like my like view on it is that<ts>  m<ts>  like the rowers kind of need to trust the coxswain so if they see me like working out with them
8557,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,oh
8558,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,then it kind of like
8559,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,okay it's more like a mental thing
8560,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8561,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,i see
8562,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,definitely<ts>  yeah like i wouldn't get cut if i had like a bad erg time because the other coxens don't even do the workouts usually
8563,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,ah
8564,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,does that make sense
8565,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,that m that's that's smart
8566,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8567,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,i didn't think about it like that
8568,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8569,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,that's cool
8570,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,but usually we like have other responsibilities so we don't up doing the work outs like especially when we're
8571,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,are the coxwains usually the captains
8572,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,no so coxens usually aren't captains because since we already have like such a big leadership role it wouldn't like make sense
8573,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,ah that's fair
8574,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,to make us captain
8575,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,that's fair
8576,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,but like i i don't think there's a rule that we can't be but
8577,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,they try to like coxswains aren't they usually like you have to weigh light right
8578,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah so the way it works is like in big races they'll have you weigh in and if you're below one twenty five like for men's coxswains at least um the weigh is one twenty five then you have to take sand with you in the boat until you are at one twenty five so it's just kind of a way to make it fair throughout the boat because if you have someone who's like ninety pounds then it's a huge advantage for that team so they try to like normalize it to a certain weight<ts>  um
8579,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,wait so my question is like you try to weigh under one twenty five
8580,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,no you want to be exactly at one twenty five<ts>  becaus
8581,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,well i'm saying like you tr your try to weigh at one twenty five
8582,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,right
8583,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,wow psh
8584,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,because if you're under then like you're gonna have to get to one twenty five anyways
8585,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,that's crazy so like someone who is like six foot tall could never be a coxswain
8586,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,and if it's like<ts>  right
8587,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,like i'm really skinny but i'm like one let's say i'm like one fifty
8588,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,like<ts>  yeah
8589,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,like i would have to weigh down to one twenty five
8590,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,right
8591,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,which is why like i would never be able to be a coxswain
8592,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8593,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,ah
8594,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,no i don't think that like you like if you're one thirty or like one thirty five it usually doesn't matter but just cause it's like such a small difference but you definitely don't want to be like too heavy because it would definitely weight the boat down and like go a lot slower
8595,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,nice
8596,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,cause the boats themselves even though they're like sixty feet long they only weigh like two hundred pounds
8597,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,ah
8598,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,which is crazy they're like really thin carbon fiber
8599,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,oh yeah wow
8600,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,mhm
8601,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so do the rowers also try to like weigh themselves down or not really
8602,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,like not usually
8603,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,cause they need muscle right
8604,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,right because usually when you weigh more it's because you have more muscle it's like that outweighs the fact that you're weighing the boat down more cause you can like pull harder
8605,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,oh
8606,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,along the row
8607,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,i see
8608,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8609,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so like as a coxswain do you like yell at people a lot
8610,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah so basically the whole time that we're on the water which is like ninety minutes or two hours like we're the coach inside the boat because we can see like what everyone's doing<ts>  with like
8611,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,do you stand up
8612,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,no so you're sitting down um you have like your own seat kind of facing the rowers
8613,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,are you in like an elevated position or not really
8614,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,no you're like pretty much the same level as them
8615,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,are you like always scanning people to see what they're doing
8616,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8617,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,ah
8618,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so basically like you face the direction that the boat's moving but all the rowers are facing you so like their backs are pointing to where you're going
8619,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,oh cause they're like going this way
8620,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8621,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,but they're actually going that way
8622,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,exactly
8623,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,ah
8624,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah<ts>  so like when they pull their like blade is in the water and it pushes the boat backwards
8625,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,okay
8626,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,um or like forwards but backwards to them
8627,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,is it like when the the oar right is it locked in to like a little thing
8628,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8629,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,alright
8630,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so that's called the oar lock
8631,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,the oar lock
8632,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so like the oar is like every time when we bring the boat down on to the dock they then the go get their oars
8633,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,okay<ts>  and then they lock it
8634,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,and then put them in<ts>  and it's just like kind of like they just put the oar in like you can move the oar in the oar lock it just kind of keeps it from like being moved to much
8635,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,mm
8636,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,um cause they still need to be able to like have it pivot when they go like up and back um on the slide<ts>  and what was i saying oh yeah so i kinda just like tell people to either like raise or lower their handle heights like fix their posture relax their shoulders like there's just so many different things that could make the boat like be offset
8637,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,oh that's cool
8638,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,like not balanced or um just like not rowing well<ts>  so i'm kind of always like looking for things to pick on
8639,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,interesting
8640,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,um just to make them better
8641,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,that sounds fun
8642,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah like in races or when we're like racing against our other boats during practices like if we're doing like a two minute piece just for like kinda to like get the heart rate up and um be competitive with each other then you don't really say as much about form it's more like you get really intense and like yelling all these motivational things to like work harder
8643,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,oh wow
8644,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,and then you like look at the other boats and call where you are relative to them cause they don't wanna look out of the boat
8645,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,okay
8646,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so
8647,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,are there like a teams and b team and like a c team
8648,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah<ts>  so the way it works is we have like a first varsity boat second varsity boat third varsity boat and they're all like eight people boats and then we have a novice boat
8649,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,hm
8650,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,um and the way that our program like arranges it is it's like one v two v have like the first and second priority
8651,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,mhm
8652,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,but then our coach puts the novice boat like above the three v like he wants that to be faster
8653,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,why
8654,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,just because in races like it's kind of more prestigious to win in the novice event than the three p event just cause
8655,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so are the worst rowers in the three p
8656,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,in the three v
8657,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,in the three v
8658,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah so he'll like if you're have novice eligibility which just means that it's your first year of college rowing then and you're like faster than people who are in the three v then he'll put you in the novice boat<ts>  but some people who are like faster than people in the novice boat can't be in it if it's like their second year or third year rowing um so like when i was a freshman i was in the novice boat and then after like two semesters i couldn't be in the novice boat anymore and then i like ended up moving up to the two v um and then like at the of last semester i was in the one v
8659,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so you're like the top coxswain
8660,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8661,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,damn that's so cool awesome
8662,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,thanks yeah
8663,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,that's that's dope
8664,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah no it's pretty cool um<ts>  but like for the rowers sometimes what we'll do is have like seat races<ts>  if it's like
8665,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,what do you mean by seat race
8666,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,you like<ts>  like
8667,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,like within the boat there are seat races
8668,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,if you<ts>  so if he wants to decide like who should be in the one v and who should be in the two v then what we'll do is like we'll race the one v and the two v like starting from like an even position like say we'll go for like five hundred meters or something
8669,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,okay
8670,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,and then we'll stop and then pull the boats together on the water and then like one person will move into the other boat and the other person will move into this boat
8671,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,oh so it's like you're manipulating
8672,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8673,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,like to see like
8674,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so it's like you're just making one change
8675,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,who is<ts>  so you're gonna see like who's making the difference
8676,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8677,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,and who's not
8678,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,and then you'll race again<ts>  and then if like this boat finished like if like the one v won the first time then the second time the one v won by less then like clearly making that switch
8679,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,oh<ts>  so then that that person that person is like really good
8680,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah the person in the two v like was better
8681,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,that switch<ts>  ah
8682,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,cause er was worse cause it made the boat go slower
8683,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so it's like very intense like if you get switched you're like okay
8684,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8685,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,like i gotta
8686,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8687,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,really bring
8688,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,like my freshman year though it was kind of like within a few weeks everything was set and like my coach knew who was faster and who was slower<ts>  but then last semester like in the spring like the one v kept losing to the two v
8689,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,oh wow
8690,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah so then he would like do tons of seat races but then it would always be back and forth like it was kind of hard to tell
8691,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,inconsistent
8692,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so i was like in the two v the whole time that all this was happening and then this other coxswain was in the one v so then at the of the season he ended up like switching the coxswains
8693,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,like in the seat race thing
8694,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,like not really in a seat race he just like for the like new england nationals he was like james you are gonna be in the one v and then the other coxswain was in the two v and like we ended up being faster than them so
8695,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so you stuck it
8696,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,like i'm not saying it was me who made the difference
8697,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,okay
8698,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,but like i kind of did<ts>  um
8699,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,that's g that's pretty cool
8700,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah
8701,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,that's awesome
8702,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,no it was awesome um like compared to the other boats like we ended up making it to the grand final and like nationals
8703,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,are you guys d three
8704,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,um so the way that men's rowing works is we're not really in the nc double a so we're not like a division
8705,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,are you a club team
8706,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,no so we're in the ira so we're like a varsity sport at tufts
8707,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,ira
8708,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,and we're like part of the nescac
8709,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,mm
8710,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,but most men's rowing programs like all the ivy leagues in mit and stanford and stuff are in the international rowing association
8711,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,so you're in that too
8712,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,yeah

9595,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,it's just like someone someone who's like a sociopath just like<ts>  doesn't like have like empathy or whatever but like
9596,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,yeah
9597,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,we don't like foster empathy completely ever like aren't we all little bit sociopathic like you can say like oh like i feel bad but like<ts>  it's like<ts>  yeah yeah we we're h we're here having a deep conversation about like the universe and fucking
9598,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,sorry but um but whatevs

9601,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,there we go oh shit
9602,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,um<ts>  it's like the<ts>  something else i find interesting is like why do we<ts>  isn't it weird that when you're born you're immediately like in<ts>  like how you the government can just send you to prison like you never agreed to be part of the society does that make sense
9603,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,yeah<ts>  they like well
9604,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,you're like forced to be in
9605,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,there's this whole like idea of like the social contract and like the consent of the governed but literally like by being born for eighteen years you have like<ts>  no consent
9606,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,there's no way to just live free like truly
9607,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,but like would we want to is the thing
9608,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,oh no<ts>  i don't t hink so but i just think it's f like
9609,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,like
9610,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,like it's crazy to think about
9611,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,and it's really weird to think that there's like really not that much that separates us from<ts>  any other animal so why do we think we're so much like different
9612,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,cause we got the brains
9613,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,well but that's my thing like why do we think that everything animals do is just like animalistic and purely evolutionary but then everything we do is somehow different
9614,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,yeah
9615,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,like i don't wanna say like everything in like psychology and shit can be explained by like the like evolutionary like
9616,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,yeah<ts>  but
9617,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,view point but like

9682,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,well not memorize<ts>  you have to like read it four times and then you like answer questions about something and then you have to stand up in front of a camera and like read it again<ts>  so bizarre
9683,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,like out loud
9684,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,yeah<ts>  and it was supposed to be like the character was black and so they were trying to see like how you played like a p i don't know

9687,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,do you feel like<ts>  any like internalized like
9688,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,no
9689,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,this some deep down like that's not what i'm trying to say but like you know how like like me like i grew up like just like surrounded<ts>  by white people so like i guess i wouldn't like know<ts>  if i had been doing something that's not right my whole life like you know i mean like
9690,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,yeah<ts>  yeah
9691,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,not<ts>  not trying to but like
9692,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,yeah
9693,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,h it could happen
9694,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,yeah
9695,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,that's like<ts>  that's why i kinda like feel bad when like celebrities get like um canceled like you know what i mean like<ts>  cause they
9696,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,well the problem is like
9697,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,is that
9698,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,ignorance is not necessarily intentional and yet it is like pretty toxic
9699,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,oh yeah i think it's absolutely toxic
9700,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,s
9701,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,i think the people who do nothing are just as bad as the people out there with like fucking hoods on
9702,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,so it's<ts>  but like sometimes<ts>  but like sometimes i get what you're saying because sometimes ignorance is like sometimes ignorance i think is um<ts>  bad like why haven't you like educated yourself but also sometimes ignorance is just like people can't help like the people they grow up around
9703,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,right
9704,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,so like<ts>  a lot of times pe people get in trouble for saying like faggot when they were like

9745,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,like what have you been doing but it kinda just like shows how like<ts>  privilege can like lead to ignorance cause like he didn't feel the need to tune into the fact that a rapist is gonna be on the supreme court cause why does he care he's
9746,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,yeah
9747,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,it doesn't really affect him

9751,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,yeah anyways it's been awhile since i talked about politics since uh<ts>  you know like me and monica don't really talk about politics<ts>  but yeah
9752,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,is she like<ts>  not liberal or whatever
9753,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,she's registered as a republican
9754,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,but like socially
9755,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,but like<ts>  so yeah she's like socially liberal but that's like kind of i kind of have a problem with people who are like just socially liberal cause like<ts>  in the us like nothing's going to change without money and like<ts>  a lot of the times<ts>  they play into each other like people of color are not just oppressed socially they're opressed like financially
9756,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,yeah
9757,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,because of a lot of the social obstacles in place and so like for someone to be like<ts>  socially liberal but still like wicked fiscally conservative just kinda like shows like
9758,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,yeah
9759,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,you<ts>  like it's like you're aware that you have privilege and you're like oh that kinda sucks but you don't really want to change it
9760,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,yeah
9761,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,like
9762,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,makes sense
9763,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,you know what i'm saying like so that just like kinda rubs me the wrong way but like she's super like open and accepting i mean i haven't really asked if she's like fiscally conservative i just know i remember she mentioned she registered republican and<ts>  she but she also has told me that she is like like social issues a very accepting stuff like that so i don't know that i don't know
9764,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,didn't she put on her um<ts>  like roommate thing
9765,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,two point five

9768,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,maybe she thought it was the other way
9769,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,no<ts>  yeah so that's definitely<ts>  not uh something i'm looking forward to<ts>  but yeah i don't know maybe she just like i don't know wanted someone like<ts>  normal
9770,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,mm yeah

10782,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,and it's like kids that go to the school and you like pick them up from school so it's a non academic it's not like tutoring or anything it's like just take the kids they um live in like low income housing low income family so they don't get to do a lot outside of school
10783,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah

10799,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10800,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10801,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i'm definitely gonna do that
10802,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,well that's something is there like anything else you wanna join
10803,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i was considering jumpstart but it's time consuming

10805,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,for
10806,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,and yeah um im it was a blessing in disguise that i didn't get into dream cause i need my it's on friday afternoons and i really like to do stuff on friday afternoons
10807,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,oh
10808,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,like bang out work or like do stuff with my friends<ts>  so it worked out
10809,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,really<ts>  yeah friday is my busiest day
10810,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,really
10811,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah i don't know how it ended up like that
10812,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,that's so sad
10813,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,like monday i have one class but friday i have four
10814,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,oh no
10815,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,and i'm like wow
10816,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,friday i have one class in the morning so it's like my day to bang out work in the afternoon and then<ts>  i don't know i don't really do much like friday nights but
10817,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10818,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,just free that made my friday night which is nice
10819,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,friday night's for sleeping for me you know i tell myself i'm gonna do work but after those classes i just
10820,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah<ts>  yeah<ts>  that's draining that's uh like tomorrow for me thursdays i have three classes but i have a lab six to nine so after that lab i'm done
10821,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10822,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i'm so tired
10823,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,wow
10824,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10825,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,you have anyth do you have any idea what you want to do
10826,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i'm thinking i wanna do i definitely want to do something bio related
10827,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10828,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,so i'm thinking bio or biotech or both um cause biotech is a major that has to be paired with another major like you can't just major in bio tech
10829,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,okay
10830,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,so i would prolly do bio biotech because the like requirements would overlap so it's not gonna be as to be as demanding as if i did another major as my second major<ts>  what about you
10831,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah<ts>  um i still have no idea what to choose for a major
10832,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10833,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,um i'm attempting to go on the pre med track so haven't started the requirements yet probably next semester<ts>  see how it goes
10834,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah it's overwhelming cause everyone says that it's fine if you don't know what you want to do but then you like pick classes and you're like but what do i pick like i could pick totally wrong
10835,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah<ts>  like i'm running out of classes to pi
10836,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah cause i don't know what then you also have to have like alternates in case they fill up by the time you get to register which is the worst that happened to me last last time
10837,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10838,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,that happened to me last last time
10839,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,that was me<ts>  all my classes were just closed and i had to rush
10840,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah<ts>  that was so stressful trying to figure it out<ts>  um cause the other thing is with crew i have practice till about eight every morning so having that like i'd prefer not to have eight thirty's i can't really do use there's usually a way around but eight am's or eight o five's whatever
10841,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10842,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,the eight thirty's like i could make but it would just make it so stressful going straight from practice to class so i like that's the other thing is i have to try to make my schedule without eight thirty's
10843,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10844,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,which i did this semester but i don't know if i can do that forever
10845,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,oh no i could not do that this semester cause the only classes available were like morning classes and i was like tired
10846,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,that stinks everybody hates them so if you have a late sign up time um and s for me instead of picking the like early stuff i ended up picking the late stuff so that's why i have like six to nine lab and stuff<ts>  it's bad what classes are you in this semester
10847,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,uh intro to psych calc one spanish and there is a seminar for first generation students
10848,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,nice
10849,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yes what about you
10850,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,um i'm in psych one<ts>  oh my god how am i forgetting french three uh bio thirteen and then comp eleven
10851,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,comp eleven
10852,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,comp eleven is the worst
10853,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,oh<ts>  i'm actually considering taking that
10854,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,oh my god
10855,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,just just to get experience in computer science
10856,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,that's what i thought too cause i have never done anything
10857,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10858,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,it's so hard like if you're willing to spend hours and hours on homework go for it
10859,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,oh my god
10860,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,um definitely like talk to other people i know i'm like particularly struggling with it cause i have no programming experience but that's like a lot of people
10861,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10862,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,um but like a lot of people have like math or math oriented brains are like really good at it
10863,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,oh
10864,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,but i'm not an incredibly mathy person
10865,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,oo
10866,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,um so just like it's doable its just very hard
10867,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,mhm
10868,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,so i spend a lot of time at office hours and that like with my friends working on homework and it's just
10869,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10870,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,it's ruled out the fact that i would study computer science so it's it's done one thing<ts>  but i figured that it's it's a good skill to have and i have learned a lot
10871,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10872,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,um<ts>  but<ts>  really hard
10873,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,oof there's like half of my floor is computer science
10874,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10875,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,so i see them like you know like gathering around the common rooms
10876,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah just
10877,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,in the middle of the night just typing away
10878,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,no<ts>  and that's what i hate is<ts>  i feel like
10879,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,there's no interaction that's what i don't like
10880,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah<ts>  no interaction and it also has like this weird culture with it that everyone just stays up late and does everything
10881,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10882,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,like if you go to halligan there's people there like all hours of the day
10883,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,no
10884,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,and like i need my sleep i can't stay up till one coding like that is not pleasant<ts>  so i don't know but sometimes you just can't avoid it but i definitely i'm gonna like i've been taking same with psych i've taken these classes to like see if i'd like them cause i never took them before
10885,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10886,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,and i'm not super interested in psych i really don't like computer science so<ts>  my experiments have like the result i guess is that i won't take these classes again but<ts>  i think it's like it that's one good thing i guess
10887,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10888,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,it makes me make some decision i guess i don't know
10889,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,mm
10890,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,what's your hardest class
10891,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,intro to psych
10892,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10893,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah but at the same time i love the material we're reading
10894,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10895,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,it's just the amount of effort is demanding memorizing and there's a lot of memorization
10896,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i agree
10897,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,the terms
10898,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,like the studying is not fun
10899,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yes but i like i like the i like the material overall
10900,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah i agree some of it's so interesting
10901,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10902,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,o one of the things i thought was really cool was when we were talking about conditioning and like the behavior modification about phobias
10903,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,oh yes
10904,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i thought that was so cool about how you can just like reverse someone's phobia that's so weird
10905,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i i wish someone could do that for me
10906,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,right<ts>  what are y what what are your phobias
10907,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,spiders they're like the biggest phobia for me
10908,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah<ts>  yeah
10909,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,what about you
10910,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,that's that's fair<ts>  i don't even know<ts>  i'm always like honestly getting lost<ts>  so vague<ts>  whatever yeah i've never been really great un with like directions and stuff<ts>  um<ts>  and i'm always afraid i'm like doing something wrong going someth like i'm afraid i'm just gonna like lose track of what day it is

10923,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i actually didn't know there was a tufts building down here
10924,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,me neither
10925,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i was lost

10929,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i i forgot the name i know it has fish in it
10930,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,oh okay mine is like i think it's emperor goose
10931,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,okay
10932,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,um cause i realized how behind i am on my studies so i've been scheduling a lot
10933,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah i have three point five so far<ts>  after today

10935,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,that's good that's good some people haven't started
10936,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i need to catch up
10937,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,at all
10938,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah<ts>  yeah that's kind of m me because i was like oh i'll just do all that once like my season ends
10939,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10940,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,and then i was like oh shoot i have like not a ton like eh i have plenty of time like i can finish it but i was like i really need to get going on this so
10941,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10942,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah<ts>  what happens if you just don't do it
10943,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i think the other option was like a seven or eight page essay
10944,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,which sounds awful
10945,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,it does
10946,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,and then if you just don't do those do you have do you like fail the class
10947,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i really don't know
10948,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,cause
10949,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,cause they don't count toward our grades
10950,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah cause the grade is just the exams and the paper so i think you do fail if you don't do any of this
10951,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,ah
10952,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i don't know
10953,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i i'll just do it it's kind of fun
10954,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10955,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,you know
10956,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah some of them are interesting one i had was not uh i'm just like in front of a computer and just like clicking buttons which wasn't super fun
10957,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,that was a lot of mine
10958,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10959,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,this is the first interactive one i've had
10960,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah which is better
10961,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah<ts>  i wish we could participate in like the studies we've discussed in class
10962,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10963,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,that's what i was expecting
10964,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah some of them some of them are really interesting
10965,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,ooh
10966,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10967,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i like the little bobo the clown doll that was really funny
10968,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,that was really funny
10969,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10970,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i think just the fact it was named bobo too makes it like i don't know but the ones that we were talking about recently were interesting too like the harlow's monkeys and stuff
10971,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10972,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,a lot of this stuff is just like our brains are so weird<ts>  i don't know it just taking this class makes me think about everything more
10973,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i just wonder like what would happen if we could unlock the rest of our brain
10974,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10975,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,it would be wild
10976,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,that's so funny i i just think it's so weird how<ts>  there's like environmental things that like physically change our brain like when they were talking about how exercise can like increase the size your hippocampus like that's crazy
10977,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10978,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,and in the book there was a study about um<ts>  i think it was it might have been sixty or seventy year old people it was like elderly people
10979,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10980,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,but when they exercise they had they had like a control group and then a group that exercised and the group that exercised like their cognitive decline like stopped like they s so the group that wasn't exercising their memory was just like failing
10981,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10982,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,but when you exercise it just like keeps your brain awake which i think is super cool
10983,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i've been trying to exercise
10984,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10985,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,since i came to tufts
10986,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,it's hard if i if i didn't have a team sport i would not
10987,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10988,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,be working out<ts>  it's so hard
10989,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,oh<ts>  oh yeah the gym the fact that it's so far
10990,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,it's so far i know
10991,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,and i'm just wondering when the snow comes you know it would be wonderful if they had like secret ungred underground tunnels that are like heated
10992,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,which some schools do
10993,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,really
10994,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10995,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,oh my goodness
10996,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah my brother went to school at the university of rochester which is in upstate new york
10997,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
10998,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,and so it's like snowy there a lot and they had it wasn't the whole campus but like under the main quads they had tunnels so you didn't have to go outside
10999,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,oh that sounds amazing
11000,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah<ts>  yeah the tunnel's really kinda creepy looking but it like gets you from point a to point b without snow so it works
11001,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah ah that would be awesome because i am not a fan of the cold
11002,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
11003,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,sometimes i wonder why did i choose tufts
11004,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
11005,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,oh darn
11006,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,did you like you obviously never had snow in california right
11007,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,no
11008,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,have you ever been in snow before
11009,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,no i haven't seen snow
11010,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,aw that's so exciting
11011,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,unless in the movies
11012,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,that's so exciting<ts>  it's not as magical as the movies
11013,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,no
11014,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,it's nice like the first day is and then it's like falling and it's all pretty
11015,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
11016,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,but then it just gets like annoying and you're you like please melt already like i want spring
11017,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
11018,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah especially when it's like i don't know you have to like wear snow boots or like some sort of boots everywhere cause like wearing any other shoe just like doesn't work and it's just not fun
11019,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,you heard about snow boots and i'm like ugh<ts>  these are so big
11020,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah<ts>  yeah snow boots or like i have bean boots just some sort of boots because sneakers don't do super well in snow
11021,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,ah
11022,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
11023,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i'm done
11024,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,and then when it it starts to like get all gross on the roads it turns like brown cause there's like dirt on the roads and that just ruins snow
11025,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,oh
11026,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i'm excited if we have like a snow day like i love the first day it's all magical and pretty and especially if i'll have no class
11027,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,oh
11028,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,and we get us like an excuse to stay in your dorm all day
11029,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i wonder how often like classes just get canceled because of snow
11030,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,i feel like probably not often cause at least in my high school when it would get canceled it was because like the roads would be dangerous like to drive to school but here we can just walk in the snow
11031,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,that's true
11032,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,so unless it's like a blizzard i feel like we'd probably still have school
11033,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,darn<ts>  even though we live on a hill i'm afraid of slipping
11034,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,but<ts>  for real yeah<ts>  um apparently you know the memorial steps
11035,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
11036,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,apparently when they put those in they realized that when it snowed it created like basically this giant like ice slide of steps cause it would melt and go down the steps so it was just like this giant brick of ice and you couldn't really walk down the stairs
11037,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,yeah
11038,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,so that was they put in those stairs this was like four years ago or something they tore the stairs out and made new stairs with the heaters underneath so now the memorial steps won't get ruined because of snow<ts>  and it's just<ts>  it's just so funny like tufts you have heated stairs so you can
11039,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,but no underground tunnels

11195,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,and stuff and a big part of it was like ethical like recruitment and like they actually address it like the thing is with students giving them credit to do is kind of bad because like it ki like it technically could more like violate ethical like kind of things
11196,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,but like they give you the option to do like a huge research paper
11197,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,that's why it's not in ethical<ts>  yeah
11198,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,so it's like do you want to like do a huge research paper
11199,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,but i st<ts>  yeah exactly
11200,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,or like do ho like hours of credit<ts>  where you don't really need to like it's like obviously i want to do the research
11201,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah exactly they're like well they give the option to back out and i'm like it's not like preferential though
11202,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,it's like it's not really an o
11203,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,like they're not really weighing it well
11204,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah<ts>  i always thought that that like option was for the people that just like didn't do it in time so it's like oh now i have to write the research cause like
11205,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah i guess
11206,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,and i have my credits done but that makes more sense actually
11207,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah<ts>  i also yeah but i just like can't imagine anyone not wanting to do the like studies
11208,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11209,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,like what like what aversion would you have to it that's so strong that you'd rather write the paper
11210,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah<ts>  maybe people would just be like oh i don't know
11211,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,right
11212,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,because you don't know what they're gonna do
11213,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i guess yeah
11214,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,like you don't know what it's about
11215,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,but like some studies are so simple
11216,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,but still<ts>  to write like to willingly write a huge research paper
11217,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11218,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,n yeah no
11219,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,like you have to do that in psych one right like there's a paper at the
11220,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,um yeah but they're not like long papers
11221,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11222,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,we've written we're gonna write two papers<ts>  and they're only six hundred words
11223,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,oh okay
11224,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,so it's like
11225,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,oh okay
11226,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,barely even a paper
11227,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,wait which ones are they
11228,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,um one of our like what are they about
11229,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11230,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,our first one was about like you pick something in the news and then like explain it
11231,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah i did that one
11232,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,and then the second one we're doing is on mnemonics
11233,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mhm<ts>  hm
11234,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i think i haven't started it yet so i don't
11235,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11236,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i can't tell you the

11242,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11243,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,and i feel like i've heard a lot of bio psych<ts>  in the past few days<ts>  mhm
11244,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11245,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,what else are you academic interests i guess
11246,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,um i'm i wanna be um md phd but like that's tentative on like if i enjoy school
11247,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11248,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,like
11249,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah cause you have to spend ten years
11250,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i don't yeah<ts>  but yeah i did like a lotta um i do like a lotta research over the summers and stuff and i shadowed this um pediatric neurosurgeon and i like really liked him
11251,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11252,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,so that's really why i was thinking about like that cause i like would have like a mixture of research and clinical work so i think i'd like that
11253,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mhm<ts>  no yeah
11254,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11255,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,it's definitely true i was like i was at the um like psych psych society grad panel advising event
11256,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mhm
11257,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,and one of the professors was talking about like the benefits of like doing a phd versus a psyd and like he's like yeah a phd is the best because you do like a little bit of everything
11258,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11259,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,he's talking specifically from a clinical point of view because he's a clinical psychologist so he's like oh in a phd you can do like research or you can work in a classroom or you can work with patients
11260,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11261,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,whereas if you do a psyd it's like you're pretty much gonna work with patients like it's the way less research and stuff<ts>  yeah i don't know what i wanna do with psych at all yet like techn i am i'm like i have a major<ts>  um clinical psych
11262,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mhm<ts>  mm
11263,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,and like it's fun so far but i lately i'm feeling like oh no like what if i want to like do other things in psych and i like can't explore that at all because the clinical psych requirements like there's a lot of them
11264,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,oh yeah
11265,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,that you have to get done
11266,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11267,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah so i was looking at like fun psychology courses like psych of bilingualism and stuff
11268,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah that's what worries me i met with my advisor the other day and she was like you're gonna have to take like<ts>  five classes and then an art class on top of it to get on track and i was like what i'm o like i'm a freshman why am i already having to take like five courses it was so crazy because like
11269,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11270,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i didn't take calculus in high school so she was like y i have to take calculus cause i need like calculus and stats to get into the higher level psych courses
11271,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,oh yeah
11272,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,so like she was like you should just take them both at the same time and i'm like i'm not good at math i don't think i can take that
11273,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i'm so bad at math too
11274,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i'm like yeah i'm not good at math i don't think i could take those two in like i think it that confuse me
11275,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah<ts>  yeah
11276,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i don't yeah
11277,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,no no no it'd be hard
11278,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah no
11279,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,wait w can you just you can just take ps stats like at tufts i'm taking a stats course right now
11280,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,that's what i was i don't know
11281,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,who's your advisor
11282,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,um jamie morgan she's one of the und admissions people<ts>  i'm probably gonna go to like the pre health people
11283,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,oh okay i don't know her<ts>  yeah
11284,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,and like talk to them
11285,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah yeah for sure
11286,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,and be like hey do i actually need to do this cause i'd prefer not to
11287,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah no that's true yeah it's weird my advisor was like honestly very useless like i remember thinking last year like they don't really do much cause like i kinda showed up and i was like here are the courses i'm thinking of taking so i can do this and she was like yeah i mean it looks good like it all fits right go ahead<ts>  like they don't do much
11288,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,okay
11289,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i think if you're like
11290,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11291,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,if you can just plan on your own you don't really need them
11292,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah<ts>  if like i feel like i didn't want to do this cause like i don't know if they had this last year but they had that like advisers like your adviser could be like your professor and like you take a class with your adviser
11293,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,oh yeah that's actually what i did and my professor was like
11294,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,and i thought that that would be better cause like you could have an advisor that was like specializing in something that you're interested in
11295,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah yeah it was really fun<ts>  do they don't have that anymore
11296,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah<ts>  i didn't no they have i just didn't do it cause i was like i don't think i want to like take a class without knowing if like that's going to get in the way of my other classes
11297,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11298,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,but like now i kind of regret it cause like all my pre med friends are like oh yeah i have like um my my person is like like a med per med school person and i'm like oh
11299,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,oh yeah<ts>  yeah
11300,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,that's that's good but i mean
11301,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,no
11302,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i don't think i would've liked to have another class anyways so
11303,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i get that<ts>  yeah yeah yeah for me it was like my adviser was um it was i took classical myth that was the class i ended up with
11304,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mhm
11305,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,and my advisor was like classics professor and i actually i'm gonna i'm double majoring in classics and i think i ended up doing that mostly because of her in that class
11306,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mm
11307,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,so like and now she's my actual advisor too so that worked out
11308,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,that's nice
11309,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah but like in psych i didn't really know anyone that well like it was so intimidating
11310,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11311,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,cause i just did psych one last year and i was like i should get an advisor cause i'm gonna apply for study abroad and you sorta need one
11312,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11313,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,cause like i have to declare and find someone<ts>  and like i don't know any professors like psych one i had three professors and it was a huge class and like they didn't know me
11314,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mhm<ts>  yeah it's ha yeah and then like even if you go to the office hours like
11315,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mhm
11316,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,the likelihood of them remembering all those kids are going to their office hours
11317,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah i know also like i mean i didn't really have a lot of questions it wasn't like i could go and just be like hey
11318,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah wasn't yeah
11319,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,what's up
11320,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,that's what i don't uh like<ts>  psych is like i feel like a lot of it is like oh yeah i knew that i just didn't know like that had a name<ts>  for what that is but like i know that
11321,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mhm<ts>  yeah a lot of like intro to psych is very um not intuitive which like common s like common sense
11322,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11323,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,like you're like oh yeah that makes sense like
11324,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11325,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i could see that<ts>  yeah i know also like i don't know i feel like before coming to college i had this like this idea that office hours are sort of like you drop in and say hi to the prof and like kinda chat but like actually being here i'm like you don't do that
11326,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah that's what they make it seem like when you tour
11327,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,and like you
11328,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,they're like yeah i just go to prof like your office hours and you'll just chat with your professor and it's like no they're like do you have a question and i'm like
11329,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah you can't just show up for nothing
11330,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,like oh okay<ts>  oh
11331,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,like hey professor i brought you a coffee or something
11332,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,they're like oh what's your question okay answered it like bye
11333,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,that's it yeah
11334,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,alright
11335,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,it's so weird
11336,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11337,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i feel like i mean i'm sure there are students who go just to talk to those like very kiss ass students probably
11338,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,but those are probably for like s yeah probably like smaller but no in bigger classes too cause there's always that one kid in the bigger class that'll like raise their hand and ask a question about like something that's not related to what you're doing
11339,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11340,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,what they just wanna ask a question
11341,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah yeah
11342,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,just to ask the question they probably do that but
11343,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i'm in this one cla i'm in um history of ancient greece right now and like it's not super big
11344,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mhm
11345,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,it's probably like i don't know sixty people like it's big for tufts but just a generally small scho small kinda class and this one kid at the of every lecture he'll like go to the professor at the front and like shake his hand and be like thank you have a like good day and i'm like what do you doing
11346,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,ee it's like
11347,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,like i get saying like bye thanks or whatever quickly but like
11348,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11349,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i've seen him shake the professor's hand
11350,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,but the but the thing is that's like probably hurting them anyways
11351,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,what are you doing
11352,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,because the professors probably like are you serious
11353,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah i can't imagine it helps
11354,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,like they're pe they're real people
11355,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,right
11356,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,they're real people like they know when you're being fake
11357,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah that would bother me a lot i feel like in high school it was a benefit i don't know why but i feel like in college the teachers are more like normal
11358,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah like
11359,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,it'd be like what are you doing<ts>  m my friend

11363,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,that's so cool i've only been like i've so far for a while i was only gonna do a minor in greece
11364,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mm

11366,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mm i like latin i've been taking it for a pretty long time
11367,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,oh yeah i took it in high school for like it was offered for two years and then my mom made me take it for like another year just with the teacher like on my own like after school
11368,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,oh
11369,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i just like sit in a room like him in his desk me at the desk in front and we'd just like do latin class<ts>  he was a funny man<ts>  yeah<ts>  how many years of latin have you taken
11370,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,um i've taken latin since the fifth grade it's only language i've ever taken
11371,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,oh okay wow
11372,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11373,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,so you're like fluent<ts>  i guess
11374,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah well as fluent as you can be in latin
11375,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,can you speak it
11376,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,but i can't like speak it<ts>  most people i kno like i could speak little things but like most people i know that like do latin they don't really speak it
11377,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,okay
11378,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,like they just use it to translate
11379,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11380,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i can translate really well<ts>  like if you give me latin like i'll know what it says
11381,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah yeah<ts>  oh i remember that being the homework like that was killer
11382,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,but<ts>  yeah
11383,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,just like a passage and be like just translate it
11384,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,they don't really like focus on speaking
11385,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,it sucked<ts>  yeah
11386,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,speaking it
11387,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,my i think that one teacher like he kind of could like a l like not great latin but like he knew like basic conversational latin
11388,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,like little yeah
11389,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,and that was so scary cause like you never meet anyone who can like speak latin
11390,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah thats yeah
11391,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11392,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i j i don't know why though because like we make it seem like it's just something that you read i i ju yeah<ts>  i don't know why
11393,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i mean it's a dead language right
11394,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah but like you could still sp like speak it i've always wondered like why don't people teach in a way that like you speak instead of just like focusing solely on translating it
11395,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i don't know actually like i just like i don't know if maybe because it's difficult like but
11396,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah maybe
11397,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,is any more difficult than like just another language
11398,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,it's like it's probably like hard to do it in your head<ts>  like whenever i like try to jus like say something in latin i have to think a lot
11399,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mhm
11400,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,cause there's like the different cases and i have to make sure everything modifies each other when i'm saying it
11401,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mhm
11402,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,it doesn't like come out naturally like i could say it but it probably won't be like correct grammar but like someone who knows latin will probably know what i'm trying to say
11403,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah<ts>  yeah yeah it's basically yeah the conjugations are all so killer
11404,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11405,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i also think why it's i mean maybe at least for like western cul like english speaking cultures is that like latins a different subject verb order
11406,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mhm<ts>  yeah
11407,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,so like that's also part of the reason it's hard but like<ts>  i don't know maybe he spoke like mandarin i think mandarin has that no like i think russian is like that
11408,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i have no idea
11409,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,it's like maybe he spoke russian he could speak latin
11410,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11411,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,right i mean that be easy
11412,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah<ts>  maybe that's what it is i don't know
11413,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,do you speak any other languages
11414,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mm mm
11415,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,oh okay<ts>  cool<ts>  how you're liking tufts how's your first year
11416,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,it's really nice i like it i'm happy that i didn't get stuck in like a nasty dorm<ts>  that's what i was scared about
11417,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,oh which dorm are you in
11418,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i'm in richardson<ts>  it's the all girls dorm

11480,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,that's what i thought when i first came here i was like it's so weird
11481,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,really
11482,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,like i'm gonna be moving in with somebody and i literally like i don't know them
11483,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11484,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,like i'm gonna be changing in a room with somebody that i've never met

11486,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,in my life
11487,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i don't know i was like i was like just seems like a part of like growing up in like the us and like north america just like you know you're gonna room with someone in college like it didn't really bother me
11488,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,and like now it's not weird to me well like when i first moved in i was like it's so weird<ts>  that i will be like in my room and somebody that i like now i know them so it's not weird
11489,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah<ts>  that's true
11490,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,but like<ts>  its just like i don't know
11491,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah i guess also maybe the reason i didn't find it that weird was cause i did summer programs
11492,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mm
11493,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,in like um like some universities like when i was in high school so i had a roommate and like a college dorm for a little bit

11496,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,i guess like especially like what you're saying about the whole like american culture thing like summer camp and stuff like
11497,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mhm
11498,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,but i never did summer camp so i

11508,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,it's not the sharing the space thing that bothered me
11509,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,it just the fact that you didn't know s the person
11510,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah
11511,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,yeah i guess that makes sense yeah i was so li i'm an only child and i loved moving into a dorm i was so happy to like have someone constantly around and like there's always people in the hallway you can like stop like pop in and say hi
11512,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,that's funny

11520,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,and like we're best friends it's so weird not being around her all the time
11521,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,mhm<ts>  you miss her a lot

12023,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,mm
12024,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,cause then i would've actually had work<ts>  but like i don't
12025,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,so you wanna take you wanna have more work
12026,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,well because be so i can take less work later on
12027,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,that's true
12028,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,cause i'm tryna double major
12029,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,oh
12030,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah with chemical engineering which is ridiculous to begin with
12031,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,that's
12032,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,i might do like astrophysics is what i'm tryna to do
12033,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,dude<ts>  stop
12034,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,i'm serious though
12035,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,what
12036,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah my i started making my schedule for next semester and i'm gonna have like five classes on thursdays
12037,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,what are you planning on on five classes on one day
12038,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah and then four four on tuesdays
12039,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,how is that even possible
12040,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,cause i go from like one o'clock till like seven
12041,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,oh my god
12042,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,straight<ts>  yeah<ts>  it's brutal
12043,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,are you sure you want to do that
12044,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,i r i don't really have a choice like i
12045,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,i th i heard the like the engineering like schedule is like really
12046,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,it's stupid
12047,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,r right
12048,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,cause you don't have any flexibility
12049,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah
12050,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,we get like<ts>  two free credits all four years and if you have ap credits you get more
12051,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,that's craz
12052,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,which i do but i'm using those ap credits for double majoring so like
12053,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,that's crazy man
12054,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah i'm tryna take uh electronics which is like physics like forty one
12055,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,kay
12056,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,it's just some physics class that contributes
12057,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,and i'm here like struggling with chem one and you're taking all these all these all these t wow<ts>  okay keep going i'm sorry
12058,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah and then so that goes towards any physics major that i want or minor i think and then i'm gonna take uh general genetics for bio
12059,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,that sounds cool
12060,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,i think it's in the forties for bio um and that'll fulfill a foundation elective for chemical engineering<ts>  uh and it doesn't have a lab which is great and then i'll be in
12061,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,didn't you want a lab though
12062,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,well but that one i don't have to take a lab
12063,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,hm mm
12064,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,cause like i could i sure i could take bio fourteen instead but that has a lab so i might as well take the one with less effort
12065,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,people say that bio fourteen is like pretty doable
12066,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah
12067,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,but
12068,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,but genetics is probably easier
12069,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,okay okay
12070,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,also bio fourteen wouldn't even fit in my schedule so
12071,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,and yeah
12072,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,i can't do that
12073,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,ps the lab and everything
12074,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah<ts>  and then es two which is coding in matlab<ts>  it's an engineering thing<ts>  uh i don't know what to think about that class we'll see um cause i'm not a big coder so
12075,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,i mean that's fine
12076,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah<ts>  and then i'll be in diff eq<ts>  uh cause i need that for chemical engineering and that also goes towards any physics major as well<ts>  and i'll be in linear algebra cause that goes towards physics majors
12077,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,crazy
12078,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yep
12079,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,so yeah i'm just thinking of like i wanna get done with chem<ts>  get that over with i i am not a fan of chem<ts>  um then i'm taking a history class this semester
12080,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,mhm
12081,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,and i'm like really loving it so if you want to fill those two free credits you should take history class with with
12082,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,history<ts>  i mean history is literally my worst subject
12083,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,re no
12084,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,because it requires studying and that's something i don't do
12085,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,it's<ts>  um it requires
12086,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,and writing papers
12087,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah<ts>  that's yeah
12088,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah
12089,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,um but if you ever want to take a history class i'm taking it with proctor and he's amazing
12090,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,okay
12091,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,um but it's like yeah a lot of essays um
12092,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,which one is it which history class
12093,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,it's called europe to eighteen fifteen
12094,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,oh y my friend was taking that you know takshay
12095,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,mm mm
12096,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,alright he was taking it i think it's to eighteen fifty it might be a different one though<ts>  he was taking it but he dropped out cause like
12097,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,why
12098,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,cause he's also an engineer and he didn't need it
12099,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,oh okay that's
12100,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,and like there was like an essay and he like procrastinated and then he got like an extension for like a week and then he still didn't get it done
12101,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,really no
12102,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah
12103,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,so but the but proctor's like awesome
12104,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah
12105,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,he like if you need more time he'll like definitely give you more time<ts>  like my essay was due on monday and like obviously
12106,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah<ts>  yeah
12107,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,um
12108,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,the usual
12109,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,and it was like so much i was like oh my god like i am not gonna finish this
12110,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah
12111,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,and so i emailed him and he was like oh wednesday's fine don't worry<ts>  i still haven't done it<ts>  so i am in the middle of that
12112,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah<ts>  i mean it seemed like that from what he said but he's like it's like too late now like<ts>  yeah he's just i'm just gonna drop the class
12113,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah
12114,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,so
12115,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,i mean but it's it was it's really interesting
12116,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah
12117,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,so but next year next semester i don't know if i should cause there's like a follow up class to like this one's zero up to eighteen fifteen and then next semester is europe since eighteen fifteen
12118,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,oh like after eighteen fifteen
12119,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah
12120,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,ah that's cool
12121,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,but um i don't know if i should take that or just like a like<ts>  i don't know any like honestly i don't know anything about the middle east<ts>  and i like kinda eh like let's let's see so<ts>  i like there's like a class on that after world war one so maybe i'll take that<ts>  but who knows
12122,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah i mean the middle east is a very interesting place<ts>  like like everything that's happened
12123,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah
12124,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,like they used to be like like they had like a huge golden age of like science and stuff
12125,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,no
12126,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,and then like now it's not very much like that
12127,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,no yeah<ts>  so exactly i wanna like kinda understand some of it
12128,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah
12129,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,um so yeah maybe that finish with chem um finish the english requirement and what's my other oh and another psych class
12130,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,mhm
12131,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,cause you know biopsych
12132,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah
12133,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,kind of
12134,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,kinda need psych
12135,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,um so i'm thinking of taking abnormal psych<ts>  but the only thing like that's kinda bothering me with that it's the like schedule a time schedule cause it only meets once a week
12136,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah<ts>  oh really
12137,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,and it's on thursdays from six thirty to nine
12138,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,oo my my uh lab for electronics is on mondays from six thirty to nine
12139,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,mm but that's different it's on on a monday<ts>  like
12140,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,oh thursday yeah
12141,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,thursday
12142,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,i mean i mean do you have classes on friday
12143,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,i don't think like if my schedule works out i wouldn't have any classes on friday
12144,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,i i don't have a choice<ts>  but at least they don't till like ten thirty which isn't bad<ts>  all every single day i at ten thirty
12145,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,no this semester is so bad i every day um it's i have chem at eight thirty
12146,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,same i have chem at or i have calc at eight thirty tuesday thurday friday which is brutal<ts>  and the past two the past two thursday nights i've gone out and like it it has not been a good idea
12147,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,it's so bad<ts>  it's not like<ts>  see no and that's exactly like<ts>  like thursday nine o'clock everybody's gonna be like getting ready and i'm just gonna be stuck in psych
12148,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yep
12149,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,but they told me it's like a really cool class
12150,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah
12151,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,so i'm like thinking about that one but maybe
12152,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,that's a long lecture
12153,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,i c<ts>  i know
12154,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,a two and a half hour lecture jeez
12155,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah
12156,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,damn
12157,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,so not a fan of it but basically it's it's pretty interesting so maybe that or e like social psych or developmental psych
12158,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,i mean do you have to take abnormal psych at some point or no
12159,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,um i yeah like it's like one of the they say like oh from these classes pick two like from this section pick two classes
12160,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,oh okay yeah yeah
12161,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,and from this section pick other two<ts>  so and then that one fits like under uh like category for the biopsych but i can ta honestly i can take any other class and i think it'll work
12162,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah you could just take it some other semester and hope that the lecture lands somewhere else
12163,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah<ts>  yeah cause i met with um my major well it's like i'm in the pre med society thing
12164,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,okay
12165,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,where i just signed up i'm like oh let's see how this goes
12166,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,just why not
12167,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,um so i signed up for that and my mentor she we had a a thing yesterday like for everyone
12168,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,mhm
12169,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,and my mentor didn't show up so i got yeah yeah
12170,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,wow that's cool
12171,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,aw awesome yeah so i got paired up with this other um girl and um she said that i should keep abnormal psych on my list but it usually like fills up so like
12172,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,pick something else as well
12173,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah
12174,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah<ts>  that's the problem with mine like if something fills up and i don't get into it i have no idea what the hell i'll do<ts>  like there's like two different ways that my schedule can go and that's it<ts>  if i just like sw switch these two classes to different um places<ts>  and that's that's all i got<ts>  so i kinda need to get in all my classes
12175,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,like co did you check your registration time
12176,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah i'm an engineers but all engineers register at the same time
12177,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,oo okay
12178,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,so i have to beat the other engineers or all freshmen engineers i think the upper classmen go before us
12179,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah upper classmen have like the
12180,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,and like genetics and and uh and electronics are probably mostly upper classmen classes<ts>  so i don't know if i'm gonna get in those
12181,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,ugh<ts>  yeah
12182,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,um and if i don't i just have to pick another hass elective and just do that even though i'm wasting time cause i kinda want those later on too
12183,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah for like a more kinda chill
12184,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,a little more well for more chill and like for situations like this
12185,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,i mean you're chill now so
12186,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,yeah but i'm not gonna be chill next semester i'm gonna die<ts>  yeah

13231,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,i don't know anything all these people they're like talking about like neurons and like nicotine receptors and i'm just like sitting there like<ts>  hm interesting
13232,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,you're like didn't do the psych reading yet
13233,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,oh i d
13234,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,don't spoil it
13235,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,can you sh i don't know it yet oh the psych reading was like actually relevant to what they're talking about which is cool but it was i like didn't finish it
13236,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,yeah when i got to the genetics stuff i was like i already know this i'm like not gonna spend twenty pages reading that
13237,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,mhm<ts>  i got through section three point one<ts>  which is all like neuron
13238,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,oh neurons and stuff i really do think it's interesting especially when you bring in like that chem knowledge<ts>  and you're like
13239,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,oh no<ts>  stay away with that chem knowledge

13243,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,and i was like oo trigger word like i know it<ts>  yeah
13244,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,did you learn about that in bio thirteen or are you gonna learn about do you do cells
13245,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,in bio thirteen
13246,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,in bio

13249,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,bio thirteen was like cell stuff i don't think we did sodium potassium pumps though i don't remember those
13250,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,no i don
13251,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,but i did them in high school for like

13253,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,i think i i think that's where i remember them bio fourteen's like plants
13254,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,was it about
13255,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,no
13256,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,was bio thirteen about like the human body at all or mostly just like
13257,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,like a cellular level kind of stuff um i don't know it was like<ts>  like the nitty gritty stuff

13546,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,for freshman's it's april fifth so i can just chill
13547,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,what that's so far away i love it
13548,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,i know they give ten weeks for freshmen
13549,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,that's so what i what is the pass fail thing like we can't do it for requirements
13550,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,you can't do it for requirements but it counts towards your credit for graduation and it can't count towards any major requirements
13551,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,so can it count towards so that so distribution requirements like i couldn't do history pass fail
13552,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,no<ts>  you cannot do it pass fail<ts>  i know it's so annoying
13553,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,then what's the point in taking something pass fail
13554,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,because like for me like psych is just a pre requisite for like other cooler classes that i want to take later
13555,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,oh mm
13556,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,so it's not like
13557,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,i see now
13558,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,you know
13559,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,cause that wouldn't be your major
13560,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,it might
13561,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,actually psych one isn't a part of the major
13562,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,but even in the it's not
13563,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,is it
13564,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,it is part of the like the full on psych major but you can if i took child development i can replace it with different class like there is a loophole
13565,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,mm
13566,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,from t i dunno
13567,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,okay<ts>  alright alright
13568,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,but we'll see if it's easy or hard cause i have ten weeks to decide you know
13569,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,yeah if you even like want to take it too

13730,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,mhm yes
13731,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,what happened
13732,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,so um<ts>  did on the volley them like festival of lights
13733,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yes yeah
13734,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah yeah yeah so um<ts>  the there was like an event at uh like that tassa put on um so i was at that at sogo and um there was like dancing and then s i don't really know how somebody like hit me from behind my knee so what i found out afterwards is that my knee dislocated
13735,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,oh
13736,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,and it tore ligaments and also like knocked off a piece of cartilage
13737,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,oh wow
13738,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,so the surgery was to like remove the piece of cartilage and um like they tighten up the ligament so
13739,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,dang<ts>  i'm so sorry<ts>  did you know like immediately that like your knee was like dislocated
13740,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,n no no no because i guess it kind of popped back in maybe i'm not really i'm not exactly sure how like what happened but um yeah i think i think that's what happened and like i kind of so like it buckled i fell down
13741,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13742,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,um<ts>  and then like some people helped me up and like the went inside and sit down and like tried to get ice and stuff um when i stood that night and then the next morning i woke up and it was like very swole and like like i kind of knew that night that i was gonna i was gonna have to go to like health services the next
13743,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13744,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,the next day but i just kind of like yeah i was like okay it's fine um and just carried on and so then the next day i went to health services um and then they look at it and they like they wrapped it up in like one of those like bandage things
13745,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13746,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,and they gave me crutches and they were like try not to put weight on it keep elevated keep rising it<ts>  but then they were uh like actually you know what it's like it's very swollen and so um i think that maybe you should go to the er so i went to lawrence memorial
13747,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13748,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,um<ts>  i went to the urgent care they like they did an x ray and stuff and they said that nothing's broken so i was like okay cool so like it's probably like sprained or like i'll it'll go better like a week or two um they were like yeah keep icing it keep it elevated yeah use the crutches you know just you know just keep a feels like i went back um i gave up on the crutches within within twenty four hours cause it was just a pain<ts>  it was just easier to live then to actually use the crutches
13749,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,m
13750,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,um<ts>  and then i had like a follow up appointment with an orthopedic doctor and like he examined my knee and stuff and he was like okay so the good news is you have a minor sprain on the mcl which is like another ligament but um the bad news it's uh like after he said that i was like okay yeah cool so like i have a minor sprain that that's cool and like the way he said it wasn't like there's good news and there's bad news it was just like oh damn it's good news then he goes oh um and the bad news is that um i think you may have torn your acl and i was like oh okay and like i kind of knew that that was bad i think i've heard of people tearin g their acl like it's it's pretty bad right

13752,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,then like he's like oh do you want me to like speak to your parents or something um and like explain it and i was like yeah that might be helpful so we called my mom um he talked to her for a bit and like explained the situation to her um yeah then i had an mri and they found out that it wasn't actually a the acl that was torn it was this ligament called the mpfo which is which is a different ligament but it's slightly better because um<ts>  the acl is like dangerous if you tear it like the rehab was very long
13753,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13754,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,the mpfl isn't as bad but
13755,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,mm so how much longer till
13756,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,so i've had the brace for like ten days now like i had the surgery on the twenty second um<ts>  next thursday i can bending my leg in degrees and then i have it for like two more weeks and then i should be out of it
13757,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,mhm<ts>  dang<ts>  see like that reminds me so much of what happened this summer to me because i mean i didn't break or not break i didn't like tear anything but i was<ts>  i was a cross country runner back in high school
13758,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,mhm
13759,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,and like i ran like track and stuff like that so like then like this past really really did too much after s after like first semester so it's i was like well on<ts>  well you have to like um like can't get back in fitness and stuff like that so
13760,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,mhm
13761,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,i was here over the summer and then i was like yeah like this gonna be my summer i'm gonna go like running every day to the gym and stuff like that and like it's gonna be perfect
13762,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,mm
13763,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,and then what was it i can't like i went back home was there for like a week and then i came back here to like um it was like pretty soon like a few days like before like the of the first summer session and then um so like i went running and then like i was feeling good so then i like ran a lot further than i probably should have
13764,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,uh huh
13765,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,and then like i came back and like everything was fine everything i ran like i think eight miles in total or something like that it's like most times i was used to like five or something um and then everything was fine like i was like stretching but then afterwards i was gonna walk to chipotle with my friend and then like on like starting on the walk there i was like huh that's that's funny like my right foot kinda hurts and then i was like no it's like fine we can just like keep walking but then like by the time like we got like like really close to chipotle i was like limping like really badly
13766,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,oh
13767,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,and i i couldn't put like any pressure on my right foot to the point like<ts>  we had to uber back
13768,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,mhm
13769,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,to campus and then the next morning i was like yeah like no like i can't like put any pressure like on this foot at all um and it like wasn't the entire foot it was just like one side of it
13770,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,mhm
13771,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,kind of<ts>  so then he like i couldn't even like walk to health services from like
13772,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,oh
13773,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,hill yeah i had to i ubered from hill to health services
13774,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,oh
13775,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,um<ts>  which was a mess cause like i hadn't like started working so i had like zero money in my account
13776,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,uh huh
13777,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,so like that was like i used the last of my money to get to health services<ts>  um<ts>  yeah and like that's like when they checked it out and everything and they were like oh yeah you should probably go to like lawrence memorial um and then i went there that was like a long wait cause it wasn't er it was<ts>  um<ts>  urgent c yeah exactly yeah
13778,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,urgent care yeah yeah i went to urgent care too
13779,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,um<ts>  and so like that was like a whole process and like they said like nothing seems wrong like an and like and then they checked if it was like a fracture or anything like like a break or any
13780,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,did they do an xray and stuff
13781,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah<ts>  um<ts>  so they were just like oh like then just like keep it elevated like ice and stuff like that so like and i had to do that for a week before i could go back to health services for like for that week i didn't do anything like i didn't go to work and like it was boring cause like i had to do all i did was like lay in bed and just like sleep for a long time and then wake up and i couldn't do anything again
13782,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13783,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,and then like<ts>  i felt so needy too cause like my roommate like hadn't started working either and so i'd like have to like order food<ts>  and then he'd have to go like get it for me because i couldn't like walk all the way down but yeah in the like what it was like they didn't figure out what it was either um<ts>  they thought it was a what was it<ts>  like the health services doctor thought that it was like tendonitis or something
13784,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,oh
13785,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,like along the right side of my foot um but then when i started doing um what's it called<ts>  not<ts>  um<ts>  not therapy it's like
13786,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,physical ther physical therapy
13787,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah physical therapy yeah yeah<ts>  and when i had to doing like pt like that's when like the guy was like yeah he's like i'm pretty sure like you had like a stress fracture or like something like that
13788,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,oh
13789,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah it's like that was i did that for like basically like the rest of the summer and like couldn't go running at all and like
13790,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,oh
13791,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,do anything that like i wanted to do<ts>  which sucked yeah and then i hadn't like been running at all for a while the first time i actually ran was the day before thanksgiving
13792,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,oh wow
13793,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,and like<ts>  i feel okay
13794,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,is it fine now
13795,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,i think yeah it's definitely gotten better like over like the past few months i think like at the beginning of school like i couldn't like put like if i stood on it for like normal stance for too long or like c like put slightly too much pressure like then it was like being like<ts>  not hurting but just like uncomfortable and so like that's when i'd have to like shift my pressure like i think like now it's like almost normalized to like the point where like i think it if i had like to like stand for like a long time cause i'm in the choir so like sometimes we're like standing too long like that's when i'll feel like a little bit discomfort but yeah i think everything's like better
13796,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,mhm
13797,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,but i think it's like like getting injured like i think during the school year it's just so much worse
13798,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah h
13799,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,because i heard a story about a guy who's on the football team i think and then at the homecoming game he got hurt
13800,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,oh
13801,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,and then i think he broke his leg or something happened but then he had to take like a semester off because like this school isn't like handicap accessible at all really
13802,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13803,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,because like every it's like all hill
13804,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13805,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,and like there's a few places that have like ramps for like wheelchairs and stuff like that
13806,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,right yeah
13807,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13808,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah i mean i kind of got lucky cause the timing of the surgery was meant that like i had the thanksgiving days off
13809,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13810,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,and then i had the weekend<ts>  um<ts>  and then i took monday off and then like like i went to i came for classes on tuesday um but like i moved back to campus on wednesday cause i was staying um at a friend's apartment like i my parents came
13811,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,mm<ts>  mm
13812,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,to like help with everything<ts>  but like if if i'd had to have had the surgery like a different time i would like i would have had to miss way more class i don't know it just would've been it would've been harder<ts>  like if it's good because
13813,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13814,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,like the surgery that i got now means i can still kind of like walk just it takes longer
13815,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13816,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,but like there was an option for a different surgery wher e they would of reattached the piece of cartilage that fell off
13817,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,oo
13818,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,um<ts>  and like and they would've like replaced my ligament instead of just tightening it up<ts>  and so that would have been like a more major surgery like i would've been in more pain so in in like that case i would've missed like so much more school i would like been bedridden probably
13819,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13820,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,and like so close to finals especially that would've just been such a nightmare
13821,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,and like not being yeah
13822,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13823,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,dang<ts>  yeah i remember like i was sad like the day after i like went to like the hospital like my friends were coming um for um the ca do you know like the calling festival
13824,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,no
13825,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,well there's like a festival like close by um more towards like the city over the summer and um<ts>  <ts>  it's called so like i didn't have tickets well like i would've bought them but then like i just didn't have any money<ts>  um<ts>  so then but i like promised him like that i'd be like that i'd like go see them at least there so like i had to call number and and say hey no like can you like drive me to davis<ts>  and then they did<ts>  which was really nice<ts>  there was just all a mess
13826,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,how how far can you get them to drive you
13827,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,um<ts>  i think if you're on a wheelchair or if you have like a specific like handicapped reason then like<ts>  i'm not exactly sure like how far i know definitely from like davis back to campus<ts>  i think so yeah
13828,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,did you get them to drive you around campus too
13829,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,no that was like the only time i really used them like other than that other than that it was like during that week i really just like stayed in the dorm<ts>  yeah<ts>  um<ts>  after that after that no i'd rather just like be going on crutches like kind of like around<ts>  and like yeah cause after that week of using crutches which sucked i hated using crutches
13830,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah that's no fun
13831,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah<ts>  um<ts>  and like then i just like up and was like<ts>  w walking around which i probably like should have been i probably should've been on crutches for like maybe like a week or two longer but
13832,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,mhm
13833,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,and i probably would've gone like better sooner but<ts>  yeah that's what happened<ts>  yeah i was like starting to get the hang of it too
13834,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,mhm
13835,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,like using crutches like on stairs
13836,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13837,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,it's not
13838,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,i like when i like the day after i hurt it when they give crutches they were like don't put any pressure on that leg so like that was hard cause i was basically like using them properly but after the surgery they were like you can put w eight on the leg so you just need to like use the crutches for support so it wasn't like hopping on them which was better
13839,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13840,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,but they're still such a pain like i gave up on them on like wednesday
13841,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah and it's also like i keep like reminding myself of it cause like it's so weird and like i like imagining how it's like for other people who like have to like use who can't can't like use their legs like for an extended period of time
13842,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13843,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,cause like in like ch like in that one week it's like<ts>  you know it's like when you're like normally walking and like you're kinda like doing like a calf extension so like then like
13844,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13845,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah so like because like i was putting like all my pressure like my left leg
13846,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,mhm
13847,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,my like left calf muscle's like bigger now than like my right one<ts>  and like i notice it a lot
13848,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah i can notice like this like this leg just like shrinking and getting smaller like
13849,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13850,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,um like the calf especially like wh when i when the brace comes off and i can finally walk normally it's gonna to be so like uneven
13851,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah
13852,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,gonna have to like do you like weights just on this leg
13853,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,i'm<ts>  that's what like yeah w now when i'm like walking up memorial steps and stuff like that like i like making a conscious effort to like when i'm like stepping up i'm like using like my right leg
13854,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,right right
13855,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,to like like
13856,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah building it up again

13951,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,so the way focus is like structured is um it's actually no go starts the same time as focus does
13952,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah i think so
13953,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,it's go focus and two together and then fit cafe and squad afterwards like i i think a day or two afterwards
13954,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,oh no i think it was the other way around
13955,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,oh was it
13956,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,cause i remember for us go started on the twenty sixth and so three of them started on the twenty sixth and three started on the twenty fourth
13957,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,oh right cause it's<ts>  um<ts>  okay no it's cafe cafe
13958,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,g go and fit gogo and fit started on the same time cafe started earlier
13959,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah cafe starts with two and focus and then go starts with fit and squad
13960,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,okay yeah yeah
13961,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,okay yeah<ts>  i knew it was either cafe or go yeah so um what's it's called<ts>  i think some change like a little bit now but like how it was like the past is that um so like you know like when you're signing up for like different pre os and stuff like that they have like descriptions so if you sign up for focus and you get accepted into focus um then there's gonna be like a second email that comes out and it'll really just be i think just information about yourself and then there's also um a bunch of different like subcategories of service what you want to do because focus is surroundings community service
13962,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,mhm
13963,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,um so there's like arts advocacy children's advocacy like environmental homelessness lgbtq advocacy um<ts>  what else<ts>  and there's like a bunch of other stuff like that too um each year there's always like new ones added on too and then once you like you choose like i think five your top five or something<ts>  and then
13964,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,mhm
13965,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,um<ts>  i'm like remembering this from like when i was a first year like i haven't like looked into this again um and then you like choose like you rank the ones that you want and then you just kind of like wish for the best
13966,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,okay
13967,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,and then like later on like towards the of the summer like or like i think mid july or something um the like sent you again like an email that has like your placement um and then like it also tells you like who else is in your group and then your leaders too
13968,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,mhm
13969,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah so like the way like focus is structured in the past is that um everyone sleeps in churches<ts>  sometimes like people like literally sleep in churches but then other times is was like buildings that are like kind of like attached to a church that like
13970,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,oh okay
13971,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,they'll like sleep in like some of like those rooms um<ts>  yeah and then um for each of like the different subcategories there's like there's not just one group for homelessness there's like homelessness one homelessness two homelessness three
13972,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,mhm
13973,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,um but they all don't necessarily like are in the same church<ts>  yeah what else can i say um it's also like it's really fun cause like than like well we kinda like stopped using family language i don't know if like you ever used like go brother or something
13974,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,um<ts>  not really
13975,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,i don't think so right cause like<ts>  yeah i think it's more of like a thing for i think two i think for fit and focus cause like when you're in like a small group with like a few only like a few other people then like in the past like you kinda like would say like you were like a family and then you'd be like oh this is like my fo brother
13976,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,uh huh
13977,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,and like my fo sister and stuff like that
13978,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,oh yeah we we used to like joke about like my quincy was my adviser we used to like joke about her being our go mom but like<ts>  she like really hated that because
13979,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,yeah yeah

14194,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,oh um it's just<ts>  culture why isn't probably cause um i used to study a little bit of art so<ts>  um i guess the environment there kind of attracts me
14195,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14196,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so
14197,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,that's cool
14198,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,stockholm especially good city<ts>  um yeah
14199,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,what engineering are you doing
14200,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,oh human factors engineer
14201,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,okay
14202,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,kind of small program
14203,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,oh that's cool
14204,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah like in my um pre at pre major advisor session we only have like seven people<ts>  in in human factors engineering
14205,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,really
14206,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i know there's including me there are only two that are major in human factors
14207,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,really that's so small
14208,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah but um on the graduating class was like forty students last year so i'm not worried people just might just switch in
14209,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,switch back in yeah
14210,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah
14211,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i know a lot of people right now that are trying to switch into engineering
14212,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,oh really
14213,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah
14214,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i was thinking about switching to arts and science
14215,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,really yeah i feel like once people get here they decide that they don't want to necessarily do what they've signed up for
14216,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah
14217,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,but yeah i have a lot of friends that came here as arts and sciences got here and then decided they wanted to do engineering
14218,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm<ts>  fair enough the reason why i want to switch to art and sciences is like i don't i don't like computer science
14219,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14220,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i've heard comp fifteen is pretty hard
14221,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah i heard that too
14222,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so but i have to take that cause that's kinda the requirements for engineering school i'm not sure but i have to take comp eleven so<ts>  yeah
14223,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,and that is not my thing my plan is to take no computer science classes
14224,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,what's your major
14225,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i wanna do either bio or bio psych

14228,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,pre med
14229,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so lots and lots of science labs

14233,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,there's an eight thirty which is the one that i'm in and there's a one thirty but i have practice during the one thirty so i'm in the eight thirty
14234,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,my f my uh roommate he's actually doing chem next semester and the only time slot available form him is the eight thirty one
14235,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14236,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,that's kinda not good
14237,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah i don't know it's good because then you get chem out of the way
14238,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,that's true that's true
14239,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,and then you can enjoy the rest of your day
14240,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,that's true
14241,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,cause you don't have to think about going to chemistry
14242,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah i have math this semester eight thirty to nine twenty something for like three days
14243,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,love a good eight thirty class i have eight thirties on monday

14251,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i feel like the worst would be to have a whole bunch of classes on friday
14252,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah no rest my goal for next semester is to have like three and three and a half days a weekend
14253,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,ew
14254,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,like my my schedule right now um it doesn't have classes on friday
14255,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,wow
14256,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,and there is no morning classes and you like yeah like so for monday wednesday and thursday i have class starts at one thirty ends about like eight or nine that's fine for me
14257,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah
14258,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,and on tuesday my class starts at three pm three thirty pm
14259,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,starts at three
14260,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah
14261,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,wow
14262,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so like basically i can sleep my whole entire morning and then grab lunch and then go back probably go back to sleep again and then go to class
14263,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,that sounds so nice my schedule for next semester i am trying to make it well i have to plan practice into my schedule
14264,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mhm
14265,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,and my practice is from one thirty to six on tuesdays through fridays yeah it's a long time<ts>  yeah
14266,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so basically you don't have any free time in the afternoon
14267,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,basically yeah and so i have mostly morning classes but the way that i have it set up which i hope works out i only have one class on friday and it's a chem recitation which isn't mandatory
14268,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mhm
14269,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,and then i only have one class on wednesdays also
14270,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14271,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,but then i have two six thirty classes like six thirty pm monday i have a six thirty lab and thursday i have a six thirty class but it's fine
14272,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,how many classes are youo taking um next semester
14273,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,four
14274,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,including the practice
14275,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah i have chem english two french four and abnormal psych
14276,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm<ts>  i i feel like the practice it's kinda hard
14277,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah it's a lot
14278,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i<ts>  i can never do like four to five or even three hours of might be three hours but not four hours of practice on a certain sports
14279,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,it's nice though because like since our team has seventy people<ts>  which is huge compared to most sports
14280,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,oh wow<ts>  yeah yeah
14281,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,uh so they don't really notice slash care if you're not there everyday
14282,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14283,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,and also like there's two different times you can come at one thirty or you can come at three and then uh mondays we have no practice and wednesdays a lot of people don't go because they can't so like this semester i went i went tuesday thursday friday because i have class on wednesdays
14284,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14285,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,and so it just works<ts>  yeah
14286,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,gotcha<ts>  how far is it from here
14287,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,ten minutes
14288,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,oh
14289,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so we take cars
14290,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i see
14291,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah
14292,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah i was uh i was i was planning to try some sports but i didn't get into basketball
14293,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,uh
14294,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so that's kinda sucks but still play basketball casually with my friends
14295,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,that's fun
14296,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,it's just like the course load right now i i just finished my mid term last week
14297,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,oh
14298,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so i'm so i'm just planning to pick up my basketball
14299,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah
14300,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,hopefully there's gonna be no exams close by i know there's a psych paper right
14301,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah the papers due next week
14302,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,on november the fifteenth
14303,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,but it's a short paper
14304,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah
14305,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,it's like a
14306,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so like six hundred words
14307,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah and like a mini summary of what you read
14308,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14309,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,which is that's easy
14310,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i asked professor sommers about like what kind of articles he's looking for because like i was kind of confused if he's only<ts>  wanting us to find news articles or news plus psychology analysis
14311,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah
14312,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so so
14313,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,what did he say
14314,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,he he said on just anything anything would anything just related to psychology it's fine<ts>  i don't know
14315,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah i need to find an article i was talking to someone yesterday who said she's doing hers on ptsd
14316,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,oh ptsd that's nice
14317,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,that's a that's a good one i feel like
14318,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i think i'm doing gender roles
14319,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,oh that's also good
14320,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,because like i'm not that into biological psychology it's just too hard for me
14321,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i prefer social psych
14322,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,same
14323,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i'm really excited about this next unit because we're doing social psych and uh
14324,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,media
14325,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,disorders
14326,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,oh disorders
14327,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah<ts>  which i think are the the cool parts
14328,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm i feel like it's so cool to like an analyze behaviors
14329,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah
14330,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,um back in my high school i still i used to take um advanced econ but this class is considered consisted off like multiple areas one part of the class we actually learn behavioral psych so that' really really cool
14331,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,really
14332,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i i really like that
14333,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah
14334,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so that's pretty nice
14335,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah that's why i wanna do abnormal psych
14336,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mhm
14337,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,because that class is about like different disorders<ts>  you learn about disorders which i think is the cool psych stuff<ts>  i like everything else
14338,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14339,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i just feel like it's more fun to to learn about what people do and don't do and also now that i've been in this class sometimes i see people and thinking about what they're doing
14340,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14341,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,like i am part of junior jumbo's
14342,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14343,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,do you know what that is<ts>  okay it's this club where you go to a preschool once a week for two hours and you have a little buddy and you play with them<ts>  like little kid my buddies three
14344,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,three years old
14345,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah<ts>  and i went last week after we had learned about attachment styles
14346,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,pretty cute
14347,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,and then i was like man i'm watching it applied in real life
14348,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm<ts>  yeah how long is the program like for the club thing
14349,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,it's the whole year
14350,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,that okay<ts>  do you gotta pick the same one next year as well if you are deciding to keep doing this club
14351,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,pick the same what
14352,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,like the same kid
14353,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,no
14354,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so like basically one kid per year
14355,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah except that someone i talked to said that oh it was a teacher that works in the preschool now that used to do the club she had one buddy for two years in a row
14356,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14357,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,and then a third different one so i guess it just depends<ts>  because
14358,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,cause i feel like i feel like it's gonna be so um<ts>  so cool i guess to keep in touch with the same person for like consecutive years
14359,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,all of it yeah
14360,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah to see what's happening around him or her
14361,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i feel like it depends on what age you get when you off
14362,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mhm
14363,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,because since it's a preschool they get too old to be there
14364,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14365,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i think the oldest you can be there is five
14366,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14367,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so in theory i could have my buddy for two years like this year and the next year
14368,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mhm
14369,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i don't know though<ts>  the youngest age is is less than two<ts>  yeah they have baby babies

14397,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so if they don't have one i'm gonna find a way to get to australia
14398,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,that's right
14399,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,also apparently the minimum wage in australia is really high
14400,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,oh
14401,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,it's like eighteen dollars eighteen us dollars the minimum wage in texas is seven fifty
14402,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,for real
14403,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah it's super i think whatever it super low
14404,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14405,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,it's higher here than it is in texas i think it's like twelve here maybe fourteen i have no clue
14406,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i'm not sure i can't do part time jobs because for international students we have to be a sophomore year to get my um social security number

14411,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,at home but i feel like it would be smart to go work in australia because then you can save up a whole bunch of money and then bring it here
14412,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,wait does tufts
14413,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,to use
14414,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,will tufts cover your tuition in australia
14415,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i think it's like carries with you
14416,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,hm
14417,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i don't really know i haven't looked that deeply into it<ts>  but also i have time
14418,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mhm<ts>  yeah it's only our freshman year
14419,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah
14420,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so<ts>  yeah i wanna study abroad too probably germany
14421,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14422,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i'm in german one
14423,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,oh cool
14424,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,trying to do like german one two three four for my freshman year and my sophomore year so that can probably study abroad
14425,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,eventually
14426,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,in my junior year or my my senior year i'm not sure cause the thing it's it's not only the culture but also the um my field in german so popular<ts>  like industrial design wise
14427,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,oh
14428,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,german has probably the best industrial design programs in the world
14429,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah
14430,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,also britain but uh
14431,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,you already speak english you're good
14432,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm<ts>  i'm trying to learn german
14433,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah that's cool
14434,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,at at least i'll yeah because if i'm going to study abroad i have to be like in german four
14435,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so that you can actually converse with people
14436,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,right
14437,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i take french
14438,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mhm
14439,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,and i wanna go to france this summer the tufts and how are maybe we'll see um but yeah i don't know i've i've been taking french for so long that when i got here i was like well i feel like i have to continue so that i can actually learn how to speak it because french programs in texas are not very good so even though i took french for like five years
14440,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mhm
14441,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i learned the exact same thing every year<ts>  which is nothing
14442,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,hm
14443,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,which isn't super helpful when you're trying to talk to people
14444,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,true<ts>  are you still learn like two years i'm in actually one year of german back in my high school but that didn't help because we only have two classes per week and sometimes the teacher would not be there so basically have self studies
14445,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,you only had class two days a week
14446,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,no i meant two days for german
14447,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,for for german
14448,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah<ts>  back at my high school<ts>  so that's not good because
14449,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,wow<ts>  yeah
14450,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,once i learn something on monday i'll basically forgot on friday
14451,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah
14452,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,and over the weekend i have no incentive to review german then back to monday i basically forgot everything again
14453,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah that's rough
14454,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm<ts>  so i basically didn't learn anything from my high school still in college
14455,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,you're you're starting over
14456,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i guess<ts>  yeah
14457,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,that's okay german seems hard i have a friend that's in german one he seems like he's struggling a little bit
14458,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14459,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,he said it's easy but also hard<ts>  at the same time
14460,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,who is his what's his name
14461,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,cole
14462,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,cole<ts>  yeah he's not in my section<ts>  yeah so yeah german's pretty fun um<ts>  yeah
14463,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so are you gonna do did you test out of any of the language requirement
14464,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,um i placed out of english cause i took ap english back in my high school um except for that one no<ts>  but i placed out of some like some physics and chemistry things<ts>  so that that that kind of helps
14465,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,oh cool
14466,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,that that that actually really helps saves my time next semester so that so that i don't have to wake up at eight thirty
14467,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i got credit for calc
14468,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,oh calc bc
14469,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,ab
14470,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mhm
14471,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so i have to take only one other math and then for english i tested out of half of the english credit<ts>  so i have to take english two
14472,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14473,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,and then for language i placed out of french two and th one and two
14474,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so you're starting in french three
14475,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so i'm in th<ts>  yeah
14476,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,that's really nice i think
14477,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah so i'm gonna do three and then i'm doing four next semester and then if i go to france over the summer i'll do five there
14478,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14479,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,and then six when i come back
14480,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,it's nice i don't th<ts>  mm<ts>  yeah for me i'm yeah i'm planning to do like german one two three four for my sophomore and freshman year
14481,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,and then are you gonna do
14482,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,study abroad
14483,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,hm
14484,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,probably<ts>  if i have that time<ts>  i really want to
14485,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah i feel like study abroad would be so fun
14486,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah
14487,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,would you go for a year or would you go for a semester
14488,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,i'll probably go for one semester
14489,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah me too i feel like it's just it just makes more sense to only go for a semester<ts>  because then that way like you don't fall behind
14490,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,right
14491,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,in anything
14492,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mhm<ts>  yeah i don't miss my family and my friends here so
14493,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah yeah because if you but also the good thing about if you go abroad junior year is like most people are also going abroad junior year
14494,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14495,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,so like you and your friends might be gone at the same time so then you come back
14496,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,true
14497,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,and it's not like like it wouldn't be fun if your friend went abroad like sophomore year and then you go junior year
14498,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah
14499,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,and then you're like friends only for freshman and senior year
14500,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm<ts>  true<ts>  yeah and another thing i'm kind of worry about studying abroad it's like<ts>  uh a definitely language problems cause although i might study one two three four that doesn't mean like it's gonna help me in the daily conversations
14501,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah<ts>  yeah
14502,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,still so is the same thing cause we we took english classes back in china but those classes don't necessarily prepare you for english conversations
14503,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah that's fair
14504,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,like<ts>  yeah so like it's only test prep
14505,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,it's different<ts>  yeah
14506,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,yeah
14507,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,but the good thing also about studying abroad is that like once you get there by the time you leave you're gonna be so good at conversation
14508,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,mm
14509,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,cause you'll only be speaking for the most part in that language for a good chunk of your time for an entire semester
14510,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,hi
14511,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,hi

15263,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,i just feel bad cause if we're coughing all up on this microphone and then somebody else gets it just like in their mouth
15264,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,antibacterial

15288,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,happening
15289,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,when like you're like beeping one would go off
15290,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,and then i would go to the bathroom
15291,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,and then it would keep beep and i would have to get up but like i didn't know how to turn it off
15292,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,you just like threw the alarm clock at the door
15293,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,i was like kept pressing buttons and then eventually it would stop but then sometimes i also hit snooze so then i would get back in bed and then it'd go off again honestly i normally just unplugged it
15294,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,and then i wouldn't notice and that's why i probably wouldn't get up the next day we'll just leave it at that<ts>  cause it still says the time even if you unplug it<ts>  it's weird
15295,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,really
15296,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,mhm<ts>  for like a couple hours and then it goes away
15297,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,that's so weird
15298,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,mhm
15299,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,why would they do that
15300,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,mm mm mm

15305,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,yeah then it just makes you late to everything
15306,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,it really does<ts>  i should put it two minutes ahead<ts>  i heard that
15307,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,or you could set it to the real time<ts>  that's just a thought though
15308,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,what good would that do
15309,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,i don't know then you would know what time it is<ts>  can you see under this<ts>  cause i wore those with the

15383,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,okay word
15384,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,i need to sneeze
15385,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,don't do it don't do it
15386,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,it's gonna hurt if i keep it in
15387,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,you can do it
15388,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,but that's a good location
15389,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,that is a good locat is that the four person one
15390,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,mhm<ts>  and i don't think nine hundred's too bad but that's six person one with the pool
15391,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,okay i don't know if that's gonna happen or not though he was like they have an open house for that today<ts>  ew it feels like you're coughing into my ear
15392,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,hey
15393,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,but they have an open house for it today but like i asked if he was like sure that it was available for like the time we need it
15394,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,mhm
15395,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,and he was like i'm somewhat sure like i'll let you know as soon as i find out<ts>  and like i'm not trying to go to the open house
15396,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,mm mm
15397,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,and also like if it is not as cheap as i think it is
15398,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,how would it not be
15399,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,it might not be i don't know dude it has a pool which is super unnecessary
15400,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,but also doesn't raise the hi price of the house
15401,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,i feel like it would
15402,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,right
15403,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,i feel it would be more expensive
15404,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,mhm<ts>  maybe we're not allowed to use it
15405,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,no it says<ts>  pool for those hot summer days so i feel like it's not just to like be there
15406,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,that's fair
15407,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,i don't know i want him to hit me back and be like it's available and it's this cheap
15408,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,it's not a lie and it's close to davis or closer in that direction
15409,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,it's in it's more like if you just from the bottom of tufts went sideways
15410,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,mm
15411,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,does that make any sense
15412,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,it's like i'm picturing near the round about now
15413,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,yeah it's like if from the round about you went like<ts>  away from tufts but not downwards towards davis like to the right

16328,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,like if i had a set three goals for my entire time at tufts the top three goals would all be to get killer calves
16329,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i feel like wa i have to every time i'm our field is down hill
16330,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,okay
16331,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,so like everyday the walk from<ts>  craft to hill is just miserable well it's not miserable but it's so far
16332,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16333,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,and three days a week i have french right after practice
16334,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,oo
16335,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,so either way i'm going like all the way to olin
16336,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,it's far
16337,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,and it's just miserable<ts>  it's so far
16338,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16339,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,especially now that it's cold it's pretty bad
16340,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,but being uphill has its benefits because if you're not going all the way down hill before class like you're at the same level as the classes like i have to walk uphill to every class
16341,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah<ts>  that's true
16342,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,and have enough of a break time in between classes where i have to go back to my dorm to like do like do work and do things
16343,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,mhm<ts>  yeah
16344,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,and then go back to class so i'm walking uphill like three or four times a day minimum
16345,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah where are most of your classes
16346,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,um probably like they're in the academic quad mostly
16347,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,okay
16348,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,but um it's nice i have one class in granoff so
16349,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,uhuh
16350,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i don't have to walk very far for that
16351,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,that's nice yeah mine is i've one in granoff too and then<ts>  i have one in eaton so that's kinda
16352,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,okay
16353,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i don't know what that counts as
16354,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,think it's still the academic quad
16355,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah and then olin and then psych
16356,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16357,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,so
16358,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,not bad
16359,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,not bad
16360,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,it works out
16361,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah i feel like if i were coming from hill oli like going to olin and going to psych would be so easy
16362,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16363,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,but like eaton in granoff doesn't really ap matter
16364,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah granoff's really easy for me
16365,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,it would be the same from anywhere<ts>  yeah
16366,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,cause it's like a one minute walk from hodge
16367,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah i have four classes on tuesdays and thursdays
16368,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,really
16369,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,but then on i have no classes wednesday and i only have one class on monday and friday so it's like a weird like i a pretty much always have a four day weekend
16370,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,that works
16371,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,which is nice
16372,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah i set up my classes differently i have two on monday tuesday wednesday and thursday
16373,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,okay
16374,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,and then i have one recitation on friday
16375,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,that's nice
16376,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,um so it works out
16377,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,that's really evenly broken up
16378,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah and i thought that would be beneficial it's not
16379,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,you don't like it
16380,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,it just means i have work due every day
16381,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah that's what i like about having wednesdays off
16382,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,mhm
16383,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,cause like i don't really have to do stuff tuesday night
16384,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16385,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,but like i can if i wanna get ahead and then i don't have to do anything thursday nights
16386,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,that works
16387,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,like i would do it again i think but i also up wasting a lot of time cause my classes like if i don't i don't have class till six pm on monday<ts>  so i up just like sleeping in too late
16388,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,really
16389,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,but you get you get you get
16390,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah i mean i have class at nine on tuesdays and thursdays i hate that
16391,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16392,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,and it's so early
16393,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i have yeah i have i have that too
16394,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,and it's weird
16395,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i have english
16396,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,cause like i had to wake up to be at school at eight in high school
16397,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,mhm
16398,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,like i thought that was early and i think this is early even though it's later
16399,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah like getting up at eight
16400,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i think it's
16401,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,like i get up at eight for my nine ams
16402,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16403,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i feel like next semster i'm gonna try and go for everything after ten
16404,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah for sure
16405,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,especially cause now like at least first semester i can't have any classes between three and five six three and six so like i have the that whole chunk of time like i couldn't put anything in my schedule for that but now i'm more flexible
16406,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,that makes sense<ts>  yeah cause of soccer sports yeah
16407,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah but i'm still trying to have wednesdays off it's really nice cause it's like it breaks up the week
16408,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,it breaks up the week yeah that would be that would be probably the most beneficial day to have off
16409,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah it's like you don't like fridays off are nice but having one class on fridays isn't the of the world
16410,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,no i have a rescitation that's not mandatory
16411,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16412,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,and like its
16413,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,what for what class is it
16414,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,for stats
16415,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,okay
16416,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,um i only have to show up if like when i pressing questions or to like we're actually learning something and they tell us in advance
16417,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,mhm<ts>  okay
16418,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,um so that helps
16419,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah do you do so do each your classes only meet twice a week except sta
16420,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,e yes except for stats which has three<ts>  including rescitation
16421,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,okay<ts>  okay
16422,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,but yeah it's nice
16423,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16424,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,one of my friends has rescitations for all of his classes
16425,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,uh huh
16426,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,and he's constantly going from like class to recitation to class
16427,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16428,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,and like he didn't do a good job spreading out his recitations either
16429,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,mhm
16430,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,on fridays he has three classes and and which are all recitations and are all mandatory
16431,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,oh my gosh i'm worried for next semester cause i'm trying to take five classes
16432,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,same though
16433,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,and then like most of them like if i take econ i'll have a rescitation
16434,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,okay
16435,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,french two will have a rescitation
16436,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16437,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i wanna take computer science
16438,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i do too but i don't know when i want to take it
16439,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i know
16440,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,like i want to take next semester but i feel like next semester's like when everyone who didn't take it first semester's gonna take it
16441,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i know
16442,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i don't it want to be a super busy class i want to be able to like learn well for that class
16443,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah<ts>  i've just heard that there's like one really really good professor and one who is not good at all
16444,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,well i don't know which is which
16445,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i know i need to figure it out too my one friend was like
16446,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,rate my professor
16447,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16448,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,work works really well
16449,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,that is a good one<ts>  my one friend told me like if you take it with her you're golden but you can't take it with this person or whatever
16450,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah<ts>  that works
16451,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,so we'll see
16452,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16453,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16454,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i don't know
16455,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i i just don't know like my next semester is going to be so much worse than this one was
16456,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah that's how i feel
16457,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,but
16458,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i took four pretty easy classes
16459,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah me too
16460,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,or classes that don't have a lot of work
16461,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16462,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,so ah
16463,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,like psych is work heavy but it's like conceptually
16464,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,it's reading heavy
16465,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,it's reading heavy
16466,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,which takes a long time but isn't that hard
16467,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah and like i feel like my notes i'm so particular about how i take my notes that it takes even longer like
16468,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,do you take notes and read at that like you take notes while you read
16469,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,so i like have tried everything like oh i used to go paragraph by paragraph which i know you're not supposed to do
16470,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,mhm
16471,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,but so then like this past time for chapter eight i would read through<ts>  all of eight point one like eight one a b c or whatever and then go back and take notes on the whole thing so like i knew like i didn't have to re read each paragraph<ts>  i kinda knew what was going on
16472,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,okay
16473,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,um but that took me like pretty much an hour for each like nine one nine two nine three nine four
16474,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,really
16475,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,like i sat in tisch from seven to eleven
16476,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,damn
16477,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,doing psych
16478,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,that's that's tough
16479,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,and it's like it's such a it's like not a waste of time but like i could have been i feel like there's got to be a better way to do it
16480,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,see i don't take notes at all when i read cause i'll just get distracted by it like i'll be a so focused on the notes versus the reading
16481,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16482,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,and i won't learn as much from it
16483,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,uh huh
16484,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i like to just read through everything and then they have a little study guide things built into the text book
16485,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16486,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,and i'll go back and do those after<ts>  just so i really master it
16487,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,like the the quizzes<ts>  or the
16488,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah like flash cards and the quizzes like go back and do those
16489,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah maybe i'll try that for chapter ten
16490,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16491,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,like i just feel like if i get through chapter nine i'll be fine cause ten is like the most recent thing we're learning
16492,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah<ts>  yeah
16493,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,and then i'll just be able to like i can just review extra for it
16494,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16495,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,for test on thursday
16496,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,that works it's the balance that i just take like really like really effective notes in class
16497,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16498,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,or i'll write down more than i necessarily need to
16499,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16500,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,but just so i have it
16501,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16502,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16503,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i feel like<ts>  my class notes could be better but it's also like i i feel like i don't pay as much attention in class because i know i have the reading to fall back on
16504,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,okay yeah
16505,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,but like that's not good like i need to be paying attention in class but we'll see
16506,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i get that sometimes there are some there are some like lectures and chapters or at least part of a lecture i'm like okay i i i g i not really getting right now just like go refer to the reading
16507,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16508,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,um and the sometimes where it's the opposite where i'll like i'll read it after like the lecture
16509,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,mhm
16510,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,and be like uh the lecture made more sense than this this doesn't make as much sense anymore
16511,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,mhm<ts>  yeah
16512,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,so but it is what it is i got
16513,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16514,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,it's really just studying for exams and learning the material
16515,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah<ts>  exactly and like the i feel like this exam will be a little easier to study for
16516,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,well not that we've seen the exam questions
16517,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16518,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,from the first one we know how to do it
16519,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yes and like it's not as much it's not as specific i feel like the material
16520,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16521,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,it's more theories and like vague stuff
16522,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,a little more vague
16523,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,whereas like last time we had to know like all the different functions
16524,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah
16525,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,and i was like lots of flash cards with that one
16526,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i spend so much time just making flashcards and then i found out they had like the flash cards built in
16527,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,i know
16528,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,and i was like really did i just spend like two days just making flashcards for no reason
16529,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,that's all my friends did the same thing and i just like i ended up procrastinating studying for that until literally the night before like i took super diligent notes<ts>  which made it easier
16530,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,mhm
16531,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,but i'm not doing that this time like i need to studying tomorrow
16532,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,you know i promised myself i'd do all the reading before all the lectures this time<ts>  uh i didn't cause i just finished chapter eight so
16533,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,yeah i finished chapter eight on thursday

16603,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,so i'm doing um i probably wanna do it like at least a semester
16604,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,mhm
16605,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um like i was thinking london would be a cool s like a good semester trip and then like it is tough cause i've been thinking about my classes and they're like lot of requirements throughout the four years
16606,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,mhm
16607,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and i'm trying to kinda like plan it out in a way where like i can still do the abroad program and meet some requirements over there
16608,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah for sure
16609,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and then come back and like still not be completely behind um<ts>  but
16610,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,are you a arts and sciences student
16611,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah i'm an art and science student<ts>  and like i'm doing the yeah the cognitive science major which is kinda it's it's definitely interesting um i'm worried about the computer science aspect
16612,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,cool<ts>  really yeah like do you do you have to do three classes right
16613,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah so you have to do like the intro comp then like data structures then you could like pick another one on like artificial intelligence or something
16614,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,mhm<ts>  at least you don't have to do comp forty
16615,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah<ts>  i'm not gonna do that yeah that i heard is awful

16617,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah<ts>  really
16618,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah and they're like<ts>  it's just like it seems like they have something to do every single day for that class
16619,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,right
16620,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,it's crazy
16621,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and you're you're in a suite that's kinda dope like i i know um the uh the only other suite i've seen is sophia gordon
16622,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,oh yeah those are so they're so nice

16631,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,okay<ts>  yeah
16632,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,but like they're like separate groups of people
16633,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,okay
16634,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and you apply all together

16639,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,okay
16640,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,that you like it's a four digit number
16641,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,right
16642,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,that like in between like fifteen hundred and three thousand
16643,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,okay

17023,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,it's definitely i think it's definitely more interesting the last unit for me
17024,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah the last unit's the first unit's really technical right
17025,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,but it's like
17026,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,it's like oh like different parts of the brain

17032,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,because i got kinda cocky after the first test because i to i took like a lot of psych in high school
17033,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,okay
17034,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,i took like i took like um like one semester of psychology
17035,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17036,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and then one semester of like neuroscience
17037,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,okay yeah um i i mean like the after the first i felt the first pretty pretty easy if you had done the memorization
17038,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah for sure
17039,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and then this one is like it's again it's a lot of memorization
17040,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,mhm it's a lot of concepts i think
17041,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah<ts>  yeah exactly it's like and like it's yeah exactly different theories and different like concepts that you have to grasp and then kinda just memorize and then just spit back out onto the test
17042,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,right<ts>  mhm
17043,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,uh when they like bring it up which is you know it's an interesting test just sixty multiple choice
17044,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,mhm
17045,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,but if you get one wrong it's like your grade drops<ts>  kinda
17046,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,no for sure it's a lot like the bio exams are the same way it's like twenty five mulitple choice questions
17047,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah<ts>  okay yeah so if you get one wrong you're already down to like a ninety six
17048,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,s<ts>  yeah it's like yeah you're down like four points yeah
17049,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17050,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,exactly it's kind of annoying
17051,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,that is yeah<ts>  that's kinda
17052,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,mhm
17053,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,but li are you so you're doing pre med so that's like physics and then as well as bio ch bio chem
17054,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah i think i forget their requirements exactly but it's like a year bio a year of chem
17055,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,okay
17056,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,like introductory stuff
17057,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17058,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,uh maybe like a semester of physics<ts>  um
17059,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,org organic chem
17060,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah orgo one orgo two or instead of orgo two you can do bio chem
17061,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,okay
17062,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um<ts>  and then it really it's actually like it's not as daunting as people think i think it's like although other than that it's just like two english classes
17063,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,really
17064,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and uh
17065,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,okay
17066,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,like some sort of statistics class
17067,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,i think i placed out of the eng i did i yeah i placed out of the writing requirement at tufts<ts>  which is nice
17068,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,oh you placed out of the yeah did you take the ap
17069,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um i took the ap i took ap lang
17070,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17071,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,in high school
17072,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,that's awesome
17073,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and i loved it so like i loved ap lang
17074,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17075,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,so it's i i placed out of the writing require<ts>  but i'm actually still doing um
17076,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,that's awesome
17077,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,intro to philosophy which counts in english too
17078,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,oh yeah it's english too
17079,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um which doesn't really matter
17080,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17081,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,but it's like i'm enjoying it it's it's not
17082,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,who do you have
17083,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,i d
17084,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,for philosophy
17085,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,i have ian blownstein
17086,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,ian blowstein i've never heard
17087,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,he's from em he's like an emerson teacher
17088,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,oh<ts>  cool
17089,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um
17090,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,what's what's like what what are you reading like what philosophy books are you reading
17091,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,so we're doing like a lot of different passages from different uh differentphilosophers
17092,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,oh cool
17093,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,like tons of different passages and right now we're talking about um we did the first two questions we wrote e we wrote essays on were like is it reasonable to fear your own death<ts>  which is kind of like whoa
17094,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,damn<ts>  yeah like existential shit
17095,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,okay<ts>  um and then um the other one was um<ts>  are we are we responsible are we ever like under what circumstances are we responsible for our actions and so i wrote about like um how there's no such thing as free will because like we're like products of our environment and our brains
17096,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17097,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and we don't really have full control over either of those two things
17098,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah for sure
17099,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and so i'm like saying like yeah we don't really have full control over those so how can we have full control over our decisions um and then just said that we're not responsible ever which is like we'll see we'll see how i do
17100,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,no that's i that's that's it's like it's a crazy like idea to wrap your head around
17101,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah exactly
17102,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,but like it's definitely like grounded in some reality<ts>  but like
17103,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17104,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,like if you're just like if every person's like a blank slate or whatever like one of those things you talk about in psych one
17105,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah<ts>  right<ts>  yeah tabula rasa
17106,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,like yeah like tabula rasa yeah like
17107,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah that's on my test tomorrow for sure
17108,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17109,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17110,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um didn't like really like have responsibility for put in such like bad situations
17111,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,exactly
17112,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,but also it makes me think of like like like social like in a social justice context like people who are like you know like born into like really destitute situations who commit crimes or whatever like extreme poverty it's like why does that person morally re reprehensible if they're just a product of their environment
17113,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah<ts>  mhm<ts>  mhm<ts>  right<ts>  exactly<ts>  mm<ts>  exactly and that's what i thought about as i was writing it was like yeah like if there there's not it's not like it's not like blind luck that there's a higher crime rate in those communities
17114,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17115,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,it's not because it's not because of their like who they are
17116,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17117,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,uh morally
17118,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,for sure
17119,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um and so like i'm like yeah the just system just seems kind of just some something society needs in order to function
17120,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,mhm
17121,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,because without it we'd just be like just killing each other out there
17122,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah there'd be we wouldn't be able to like we need to feel some sort of like
17123,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and just<ts>  yeah
17124,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,reperat like reparation i guess for like a bad
17125,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,exactly
17126,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,you wanna see things re repair made right
17127,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah<ts>  yeah<ts>  exactly so we have to s sign some sort of accountability to people
17128,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,mhm
17129,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,which is you know i mean like it's it's definitely it's a tough concept to gra the whole class is kinda um is kinda crazy kinda trippy
17130,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,no for sure
17131,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,cause like it's you know we g we get into like just we like we'll read a passage and i'll go into class like thinking we're gonna talk about like the like a like the broad theme of it and we just get so into it<ts>  and like so into like these details
17132,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,i'm sure like each little sentence and
17133,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,exactly<ts>  and it's kinda just like and i i enjoy it i have friends in the class who's who say like yeah i just don't like the class setting cause it's kind of a discussion<ts>  it's like literally it's it's like a room that's like the size of these two rooms combined
17134,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,wait literally l what what what room is it
17135,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,it's minor it's in minor so it's two twenty one
17136,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,oh okay yeah i know minor yeah<ts>  yeah okay
17137,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,so second floor like just to the left
17138,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah just straight in
17139,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,it's it's like a business kinda it looks feels like a business meeting<ts>  like cr conference in that room
17140,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,mhm<ts>  oh cool
17141,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,so it's just one desk and we're all just sitting around it like having like discussions
17142,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah like like yeah just discussion based classrooms
17143,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and like bouncing stuff<ts>  yeah<ts>  and just bounce
17144,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah we have that we had that for my english class i'm in english five its for like for the premed english requirement
17145,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,okay
17146,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,whatever
17147,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,right
17148,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,it's like creative writing
17149,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,okay yeah
17150,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and we all like sit around in like a circle and there's te eight of us or ten of us not everyone shows up
17151,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17152,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and we like everyone writes their own draft of a of their creative story
17153,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,okay
17154,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and we all like sit around and read each other's stories<ts>  and then like workshop them
17155,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17156,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and like everyone has their turn to have their story be the focus
17157,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,okay
17158,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and everyone talks and like tells them
17159,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,oh that's kind of cool yeah
17160,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah like tells them how like their story could be better the things they liked like the things they don't like
17161,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah<ts>  yeah
17162,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and you have to like lead your own workshop and like when it's your story you have to like ask questions
17163,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,okay
17164,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and then do like a writing experience like i but i feel like it's really stressful sometimes when like everyone's just like staring at you around the circle
17165,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah i feel that
17166,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,it makes me like fear like like what a real meeting is like
17167,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah<ts>  yeah that's true i mean i remember in high school i did my junior year when i did ap lang
17168,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,mhm
17169,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,we did that we would have like and we would when we'd have a draft of our essays or even when we have our essays we'd go around and like not read the whole thing but like share what we talked about
17170,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,mhm
17171,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and then we have like it'd just be open for like feedback slash criticism um and it was it's i always loved doing it because like i got really into the stuff i was writing about um and like that helped everything else in that class<ts>  like that i loved it only because like we got to pick what we wrote about
17172,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,no
17173,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,we got to choose what we wanted to write and so um i'd always pick s i'd always pick like controversial issues
17174,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,hm
17175,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and then i would um i would really just take different sides like on it like i wouldn't i would i would um i would never be like politically stable like on a certain like uh issue and i would try to like really like s fight for different arguments
17176,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,prevent present both sides of it
17177,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah and like and like fight for like and like f like really fight for both of them
17178,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah for sure
17179,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and then kinda at the be like well here's the one that just has the facts and like that makes sense
17180,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17181,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um
17182,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,no that best i feel like i'm on the best like the best like paper is the one that opens up a discussion like that<ts>  that sort of presents both sides
17183,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah<ts>  yeah exactly and it was just fun doing that like it it was it was i was getting more out of it i think because um i was getting different like perspectives on a lot of issues
17184,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and then like<ts>  mhm
17185,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um and i felt like that was like and i think important thing i kind of want to take that the college i just make sure like um everyone hears each other um
17186,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17187,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,because like that's important
17188,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,that's true especially when yeah people don't always want to hear
17189,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,that's like<ts>  right
17190,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,especially when they have different opinions
17191,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,people like yeah especially with you know like speech nowadays it's like people want to hear the speech that they agree with often times more than like they don't want to hear the speech that don't agree with<ts>  which is
17192,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,for sure
17193,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um which makes sense but then it's like you're missing a whole other asp like side to it and i think it strengthens your own beliefs like hearing the other side
17194,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,for sure
17195,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,like even if you hear like it even if it doesn't change your mind you might even be like more so like involved in what you had previously thought
17196,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,mhm
17197,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,just because you're like well that really doesn't make sense
17198,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah yeah i really disagree with like yeah
17199,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and that's actually dangerous
17200,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and like now i understand how you're thinking more
17201,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah and like
17202,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and likei can see why it's so dangerous
17203,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,exactly and then maybe you could actually solve the issue better
17204,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17205,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,if like if that's the case which i think is like i think that's an issue like across the entire country in terms like college campuses like everywhere

17308,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah<ts>  we we are sort of fighting for it back
17309,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um
17310,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,we actually moved into a d one league this year
17311,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,oh really
17312,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah out from d three so like we play with u conn and bc
17313,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,okay<ts>  yeah
17314,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and northeastern
17315,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,that's definitely yeah
17316,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um
17317,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,for for tennis i we just had sectionals
17318,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,oh shit
17319,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and we played um like we were playing like d one teams which was like surprising we were like yeah we we played dartmouth we played brown we played uh b um bc yeah we played bc
17320,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,but there's some like really really good tennis players<ts>  on some of those t
17321,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah<ts>  uh dartmouth had like an ex varsity player that just was just crazy good
17322,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17323,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um and then we we played mit um and which was d three and then um a few other d three schools but we definitely had some d one schools in there that were like clearly d one but we actually we we beat we beat brown
17324,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah<ts>  oh awesome
17325,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um<ts>  and
17326,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,wait sohow does how does how does it<ts>  how does it work for like so it's like individual competition for tennis but like i guess it's in a team setting
17327,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,so yeah it's it's w it's interesting so it's like there we play one single one men's singles one girl singles one mixed doubles
17328,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,mhm
17329,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,one men's doubles one women's doubles
17330,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,oh then it's a
17331,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,uh and out of five so you play five matches and you play to s and you play a set so to six
17332,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17333,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um and then you add up your games so all the games you win
17334,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,oh so yeah the games won
17335,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and whoever has more games at the continues
17336,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,cool<ts>  that makes sense because it's like at least you're getting a like you're given like the full spread of like
17337,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,which<ts>  yeah it's it's d it's yeah you're given like the spread of this course like if you beat someone six three it actually matters if you beat them six three or six zero
17338,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17339,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,like those three could up helping them which is it's not i'm not used to that cause like part of like some of my strategy could be to like um you know like give in to a game like play a long game and like even if you lose the game it's not a big deal because the next one is the one you were like planning for
17340,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,mhm
17341,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,like to serve it out
17342,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,the one that yeah like you were like like wait so is that a different format than like the high school format that you're used to
17343,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah yeah high school um ma by match<ts>  so you you'd play three three singles four doubles matches so out of seven and best of seven so four f if you had four wins you win
17344,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,oh<ts>  then you just win
17345,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah
17346,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,okay so it's
17347,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,and then you move on<ts>  which
17348,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah so there's a lot less pressure on each game basically
17349,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,exactly yeah and i think there's all there is there is i was definitely not used to um the environment because like in high school sectionals was like that was huge like we had practice for like two months together we like worked hard and then we'd go off to sectionals and like it be like a big it'd be a big deal
17350,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,mhm
17351,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um and like if we lost it'd be like we'd be like pretty devastated um and then here lot of pressure like people really wanted to move on
17352,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah i bet people really wanna win
17353,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um it was weird because it was we had we had practice for like two or three weeks honestly before sectionals
17354,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,oh wow
17355,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,so it was like
17356,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,so how long is your season
17357,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um the season was like a month it's over now
17358,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,really<ts>  so sectionals yeah that was the
17359,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,yeah<ts>  um sectionals was like the of it we almost made to nationals we lost
17360,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,uh crap
17361,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,literally the last possible match by one game
17362,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,good showing at least
17363,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,um yeah against we loss against bc
17364,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,against who who win<ts>  oh sh

18276,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,the day after christmas man
18277,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18278,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,you so you basically have a week then you're gone
18279,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18280,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,dang
18281,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah i have to like get back like pack like you know figure out what i need
18282,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah you basically have to pack as soon as you get back
18283,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah like pa like unpack and then pack again like right away
18284,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18285,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,so
18286,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,dang
18287,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah<ts>  we'll see i do you think it's gonna be harder than tufts like i feel like it it shouldn't be
18288,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,are you gonna what's the university university of london or
18289,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah it's like one of the campuses for university of london
18290,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,i feel like<ts>  what classes are you taking
18291,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,so i'm taking biochem that's like the only difficult class
18292,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,oh i think yeah
18293,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,and then like three other like cl like arts classes or like like london it's museums like architecture in london like<ts>  classes that like are easy
18294,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,i think that you'll be fine<ts>  you'll be i think like the only cla yeah biochem that's about
18295,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah<ts>  yeah i'm like gonna devote most of my time to that
18296,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18297,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,um yeah plus the way uh classes work there it's like different cause it's mostly just like studying on your own and then at the of the semester there's like a big exam that's worth the majority of your grade so like for biochem the final's like seventy five percent so like it's like very different than here
18298,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yo yeah i think so my girlfriend took biochem uh last year<ts>  and like for at tufts like with the bio bio chem like they break it i don't know if it'll apply for this upcoming semester but like he like basically like scaled like your exams
18299,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,mhm
18300,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,by and by scaling like say like you did like bad on like or like you didn't do as well on that
18301,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,okay so he weighed the one that you did well on
18302,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah he weighed the one you did well on
18303,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,more
18304,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,like the highest percentage yeah
18305,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,okay<ts>  yeah
18306,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,which is like i i like that
18307,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah actually a lot of like engineering classes and some math classes do that like i've heard
18308,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18309,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,so yeah that's that's pretty good
18310,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,did you ever consider engineering
18311,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,um i did so in the beginning i was thinking of doing cs and pre med at the same time it's not like exactly engineering but it's like kind of in that field
18312,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,mhm yeah nah it's similar
18313,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,uh but i quickly realize like it's gonna take up so much time like my gpa is probably gonna be a lot lower than if i major in something like slightly easier
18314,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18315,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,i mean like yeah the plus is that like if i decide to not like do pre med them like i can get like a great job
18316,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,you can do a great job out of comp sci
18317,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,but
18318,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18319,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah but i decided that like i'll just go all in with like pre med<ts>  and then like
18320,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18321,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,kind of i think that's like the best way to do it
18322,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,nah
18323,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,cause i don't want to like sit on like t two places at once
18324,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,exactly
18325,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,and then at the like kind of be like in the middle somewhere
18326,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,exactly<ts>  yeah
18327,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,you know
18328,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,cause like i had a friend who he was pre med as well uh and comp sci
18329,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,mhm
18330,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,and he was kind of doing that and then like yeah it didn't work out
18331,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,oh really
18332,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah he up dropping pre med cause yeah he's like it's not like it's hard to do tha i think especially the comp sci
18333,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18334,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,and pre med theres so so much s such time consuming classes
18335,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,because it's so much time<ts>  mhm
18336,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,that<ts>  yeah
18337,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah like i see a lot of my housemates like struggling like with their like cs assignments
18338,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18339,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,like
18340,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,bro that's
18341,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,i don't know i can't can't do that
18342,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,y but you you have coding experience though like from cause you've taken the comp sci courses you need for cbs right
18343,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah most of them i need like one more
18344,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,you need one more
18345,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,senior year<ts>  yeah i was like doing like pretty well like comp eleven i did really well<ts>  like comp fifteen like i was like on par with like and all my friends like doing just as well
18346,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah<ts>  really
18347,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,so like if i did it i probably could've done it
18348,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,you would've been good in comp sci
18349,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah<ts>  but like also what i didn't like was like when i was doing an assignment like i would think about that assignment like twenty four seven until i finished it it would like consume my mind so like i really like didn't like that<ts>  i'm like i want to stop thinking about that
18350,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,i feel like you're still like that
18351,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,but i don't want that
18352,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,i i feel like you're still like that though
18353,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,really<ts>  i don't know<ts>  it doesn't like
18354,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,not not probably not to as high a degree with comp sci cause i feel like comp sci's a little more time consuming<ts>  with assignments
18355,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,cause like you're constantly thinking of like how to solve the the problem
18356,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah you're definitely not thinking about psych stats assignments
18357,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,eh nah dude fuck that<ts>  um
18358,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18359,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah no but i try to like you know take it easy like on the weekends and like
18360,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18361,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,chill out like not like
18362,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah you sleep in today
18363,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,stress too much yeah yeah i went to bed at like three
18364,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,damn
18365,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,so i slept till like eleven
18366,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,oh yeah cause you were playing poker
18367,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah dude
18368,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,how was it though
18369,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,it was really fun so
18370,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18371,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,so uh we went over to um my suitemates from last year they have a house on whitman i think
18372,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,i don't know where that is
18373,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,so yeah but we went over
18374,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,but<ts>  okay
18375,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,we had like seven people<ts>  playing the th
18376,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,oh that's nice
18377,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18378,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,you had a little squad
18379,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah so it started with six and then this girl came over who's like a mutual friend
18380,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18381,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,i felt kinda bad cause she wanted to play but like she didn't really know what she was doing at all so like yeah she would like put in a ton of money and then like when it came to like showdown like she didn't really have like anything almost so like she would just take her money
18382,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18383,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,um so she got out pretty quick and then two other guys got out and it was like four of us um for like two hours probably cause
18384,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,damn
18385,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,so we played like two hours initially then another two hours with four people and the last hand that we played um it was like a really interesting hand and i got the um m i got the straight like on the last card on the river
18386,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,mhm
18387,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,so i like took all his chips cause he went all in and like i just like doubled up basically
18388,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,dang
18389,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,so i ended up with the biggest stack

18637,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,so yeah it's like pretty pretty useful
18638,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,no i and like i started doing i think this has been the first semester i've done this just cause like yeah<ts>  most of my classe okay so if i get like the i told you about um the autism class<ts>  so like
18639,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,aw yeah like um it was like bio like
18640,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,no it's a psych actually bro
18641,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,y it's a psych but isn't it like focused on like the um the like pathol or like something about autism that's related to bi biology
18642,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah like neuro neuro dev like the
18643,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,n neurobiology of autism right or something
18644,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah so it's a l it's it's a lot but bro the fa so like i talked to people who had taken the class
18645,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,mhm
18646,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,okay so you want the the grade breakdown's weird and i don't know like how like uh i guess i'll like get a better sense if i get this class how like they grade it but y okay so the class is two and a half hours once a week
18647,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,mhm
18648,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,like there's like one period for that
18649,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18650,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,and like your grades are based on you have to lead<ts>  a class one of the one of the days like that full two and a half hours
18651,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,the fuck that's that's mad work
18652,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,that's what i'm saying that's what i'm saying
18653,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,that's mad work
18654,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,like how do you do that for so i don't know how
18655,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,maybe it's a group no<ts>  mm
18656,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,i feel like so the class is the class is the class is twenty people
18657,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,like it's at least gotta be like two or three of you like leading the class
18658,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,bro it's gotta be at least like two people
18659,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,oh okay<ts>  yeah
18660,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,like
18661,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,cause there's not enough classes
18662,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,to lead a class discussion
18663,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,like<ts>  there's probably more
18664,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,and i but like
18665,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,but
18666,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,if like not as many people sign up for the class yo it might be looking a little trash where i'll just be by my by myself leading it<ts>  so yeah you have to lead a two and a half hour like uh discussion on like certain like papers
18667,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,okay
18668,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,on autism neurodevel and then like you have two papers so there's a midterm paper seven pages and the final paper is twelve pages but the final paper is building off of your midterm
18669,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah it sounds like a like a classic like seminar class
18670,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18671,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,where like mostly you discuss like research papers
18672,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,so it's basically a seminar<ts>  yeah
18673,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,and like kind of focus around that like n new developments
18674,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18675,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,and like what has been learned about autism
18676,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18677,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,cause my neuroscience of stress class is basically that<ts>  like we discussed papers
18678,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18679,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,um we have like three quizzes that are based on papers uh then we have like participation's like worth a lot so we talk about it and then we have like a presentation that needs to be like basically the whole class so like
18680,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,mhm
18681,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,an hour and fifteen and then there's like a final paper based off of the presentation
18682,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,oh yeah
18683,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,so
18684,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,so similar classes
18685,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah it's really like similar concept
18686,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah<ts>  so like i so far in that cla it hasn't been too bad right
18687,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,no it's honestly not that much work
18688,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,yeah
18689,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,like there's like a paper a week

19280,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah downsizing
19281,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,downsizing yeah exactly and like they they got their offer to shrink down and then they're like they translated their money in like big person terms to little person terms so like their savings went from like forty thousand to like five million<ts>  because it's like
19282,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,how
19283,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,b because when you're smaller like to build a house<ts>  it's just like
19284,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19285,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,inexpensive like you you just like don't ha like you know i mean like a huge house might be like this big
19286,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19287,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,so it's like that might cost like a hundred dollars to make<ts>  you know what i'm saying
19288,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,no not at all
19289,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,okay so it's kind of like<ts>  oh ah ah wait this is a g this is a good way to think about it
19290,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,is this like an alternate world
19291,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,no it's like no it's like this company has figured out how to like shrink people down
19292,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,oh sh like physically shrink
19293,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19294,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,oh so it's like literal downsizing
19295,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,oh yeah
19296,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,i thought you meant like getting fired
19297,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,oh<ts>  no like they're like literally they're just like smaller
19298,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,oh they're small okay
19299,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah<ts>  and therefore like their money buys more
19300,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,more yeah
19301,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19302,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,that's so that's that's interesting actually
19303,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,no it it that sounded really the the trailer was good too
19304,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,they're smaller so they don't yeah they don't need as much food they need a smaller house
19305,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,exactly yeah
19306,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,um
19307,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,no yeah i think the one example they use in the trailer was like<ts>  they bought like a bottle of champagne and it lasted them like five years or something because they were just so big and they're not that big
19308,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19309,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,which is kind of funny

19320,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,uh huh
19321,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,you pay like it's like a ten dollars subscription or something and you can go to a you can go to like unlimited movies per month<ts>  at participating theatres
19322,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,interesting
19323,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,which is like kind of crazy cause like one movie ticket
19324,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19325,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,is probably like ten bucks
19326,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,you pay ten dollars a month
19327,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah it's why it's insane
19328,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,are they just hope
19329,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,i didn't really understand it either
19330,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,i don't understand that model
19331,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,how i don't get how they make money
19332,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah i know
19333,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,doesn't make any sense
19334,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,do like unless they have like agreements with the<ts>  um
19335,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,like i can see how that might work like in bulk
19336,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,well yeah if you have enough people doing it yeah but<ts>  if you<ts>  like maybe if they had agreements with like each of the individual movie theaters like they get some kind of a cause like the people are gonna go and probably buy snacks and stuff too if they're getting the movies for free
19337,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,oh true<ts>  oh and you know it's like maybe it's also like i have it like i have the subscription and i want to go to the movie
19338,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19339,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,but maybe like my girlfriend doesn't or like my friend doesn't so when we go like they still have to pay
19340,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah or like you get<ts>  but if you got like a like they give you like a card and you like show it every time you go in and they like keep track of how many people are um and like the movie theater keeps track of like each everyone who shows like the card what this like that says you have this subscription and then um
19341,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19342,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,and then basically you get<ts>  a little like i guess commission off each person who uses i don't know
19343,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah<ts>  i don't know i just thought it was interesting<ts>  because it's like

19416,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,um<ts>  but yeah no so it's so it's going well i think that's that hasn't really been a problem i kinda want to do the assignment this weekend
19417,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,um<ts>  mhm
19418,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,assignment one to get it out of the way
19419,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,it does not look very difficult
19420,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,it doesn't you just need to find two articles and so i just need to spend the time to do that
19421,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,mhm
19422,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,um<ts>  comp sci has been like
19423,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,comp eleven yeah
19424,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah<ts>  has been
19425,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,do you like it or
19426,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah i like it it it feels so good to like finally get your program working
19427,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,finish your code<ts>  yeah<ts>  mhm
19428,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,like after just struggling through it and like getting getting back syntax errors and um<ts>  like oh and just or just like having it not work at all
19429,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19430,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,kinda like having to figure out why um but
19431,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,i feel like i'd like that class
19432,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,it<ts>  i yeah i think you would it definitely it definitely takes time
19433,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19434,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah i like that
19435,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,like it's definitely like it's
19436,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,definitely a week's worth of work<ts>  cause like you get assig like the way it works is you get assigned homework on thursday
19437,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah<ts>  mhm
19438,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,and then basically you have ne till next thursday to do it all<ts>  um so
19439,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,h how do you guys have like midterms and stuff in that
19440,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,i don't know i'm kind of scared because like coding takes me a while and if we have to do like coding in class
19441,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,mm there's no i don't really don't think they make you do that
19442,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,i hope not i don't know i i i'll have to ask henry see what they did
19443,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,he's a he's a comp sci major right
19444,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah he's in comp fifteen right now
19445,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,i heard that's fucking difficult
19446,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah<ts>  i'm sure
19447,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah i wanted to take i actually wanted to take comp eleven this semester
19448,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19449,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,i decided to take calc three instead i'll just take it cause i didn't want to take both
19450,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah that's probably a smart move
19451,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,um<ts>  yeah so i'll take it probably in the fall
19452,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah i w wanted to take comp ten just cause it was like it's like comp eleven except not for majors
19453,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,mhm
19454,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,like comp sci majors so it's like a lot more easy going
19455,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19456,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,but i l i literally showed up for the class the first week back and<ts>  like i get there and there are the class is just absolutely packed
19457,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19458,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,like everyone on the waitlist showed up
19459,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19460,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,um so we were like twenty people over capacity
19461,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,geez how big is the class
19462,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,not that big i think it was only supposed to hold like thirty thirty five people
19463,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,mhm yeah
19464,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,mm but there ended up being like fifty people there
19465,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,damn
19466,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,um<ts>  e<ts>  s but like i was looking around and i'm pretty sure i was the only freshman in that room
19467,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19468,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,um<ts>  and so yeah he like at the of class he was like gonna try and like um find a bigger room so like he could accommodate all the people that wanted to take the class which is cool but then like he got an email from people saying like no we can't give you a bigger room you need to just say no
19469,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,they needed to cap the classes
19470,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19471,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,that makes sense
19472,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,unfortunately
19473,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,but you know i how do you like the guy i heard he's a little bit of a character
19474,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,which one
19475,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,the comp sci guy
19476,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,uh oh the professor
19477,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19478,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah he<ts>  yeah he's<ts>  definitely interesting<ts>  he<ts>  i don't know it's like hard to describe him he's<ts>  he's definitely he's very smart
19479,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,mhm
19480,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,that's for sure um and<ts>  he's like<ts>  his sense of humor is kind of like um<ts>  it's so hard to explain
19481,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19482,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,it's kind of like a computer in a way he um<ts>  where like cause like computer science like you have to have each step laid out
19483,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,mhm
19484,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,um and so it
19485,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,that's what is jokes are like
19486,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah kind of so he um<ts>  and he's like he always like says like oh cannot process because blank is<ts>  i don't know it's hard
19487,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,what what does he like go through code in class or
19488,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,n uh ki it's more of like the concept so like how to make how to do repetition um and like how to make the code do the same thing over and over for like an x amount of times um um so it's more like bigger concepts like that
19489,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,mhm
19490,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,last class which was helpful he like kinda went through how the computer thought about where like you have you basically have your code and then<ts>  your or yeah you have your code and then<ts>  a lot of what coding is is functions which is like code inside of it's like<ts>  a string it's a s it's a string with like code inside of it so if you call the function than the code that's inside the function will run and you'll get like a
19491,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,a c c<ts>  oh
19492,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,so like x squared for example
19493,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,sure
19494,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,like that's that would be like a he had the square function or whatever
19495,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,mhm
19496,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,if you like name your function like square and then wrote inside it how to like how exactly one would go about squaring a number that's inputted
19497,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19498,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,then um basically when you call a function and it'll run well it'll ask you to like input a number and then a like run the code and it'll um give you a number back and so he like basically talked about how the computer will<ts>  kind of for each action within the um within the code inside the function it'll like um so if you wanted it to print hi or whatever it would like create an activation record
19499,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,mhm
19500,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,for print
19501,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19502,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,and then it will like it like analyze what it wants to print so it'll be like okay it wants me to print hi i can do that
19503,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,okay
19504,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,it'll send that back
19505,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,it's pretty cool
19506,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,it'll print that and then the activation record will go away and<ts>  it<ts>  i don't know it that especially just kinda helped me like wrap my head around um<ts>  like what the computer is actually doing or we're doing
19507,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah it's definitely it's definitely a really cool field like my dad like<ts>  um was like no like i'm helping pay for your like college education this is the one class you need to take
19508,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19509,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,which is c like comp eleven
19510,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,i mean that's fair
19511,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,um
19512,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,i'd say that's fair
19513,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,no no no and i like wanna take it anyway
19514,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19515,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,like he i think he was like kind of joking but
19516,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,my dad thinks it yeah thinks the same way it thinks it should all<ts>  um
19517,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,just at least like for everybody to like understand like even though like even though comp eleven is just like the basics right it's c plus plus
19518,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah<ts>  oh well we're doing python and c plus plus
19519,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,okay<ts>  but like so like just like now like you since you're able to code in both of those it like enables you to do jobs were like which are like eighty percent co eighty eighty percent noncoding
19520,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19521,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,but like twenty percent coding
19522,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah apparently after<ts>  comp eleven and comp fifteen we're at like an employable level of
19523,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,really
19524,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,that's that's what someone told me i don't know
19525,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,that's pretty cool
19526,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,if it's true<ts>  yeah
19527,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,you think you're gonna keep going or no
19528,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,uh depen we'll see how the rest of the semester goes
19529,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19530,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,we'll figure it out from here
19531,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,definitely<ts>  so i'm taking this intro to finance class with uh<ts>  this my professor's name is david driscoll<ts>  he's like this guy who's never taught before he's a tufts alum<ts>  um and he worked in finance for like i don't know thirty years or whatever<ts>  and now he's teaching us
19532,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19533,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,he's such a character it's hilarious<ts>  he's ma he's like really funny
19534,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,really probably that's good
19535,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah he's he's also he's actually like a good teacher
19536,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,is he a good teacher
19537,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,like<ts>  feel like a lot of those people are like don't really know how to tea like you know like it's like knowing the information doesn't enable you to teach the information
19538,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,that's true
19539,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,right it's like
19540,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,how well you convey it to people who don't know
19541,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,exactly and it's like using like techniques<ts>  to try and like i don't know
19542,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19543,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,like like j yeah exactly like just like demonstrate it in a way that makes sense to people um
19544,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19545,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,but yeah he's he's doing a good job it's actually it's rea it's a really interesting class
19546,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,what do you guys what do you guys do what do you learn about
19547,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,so like we started off with like talking about present and future value of money
19548,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,okay
19549,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,um so is that that part has been pretty like equation heavy
19550,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,equations yeah
19551,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,so it's been like you know<ts>  f v equals p v times the rate
19552,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19553,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,to like
19554,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,r t or whatever
19555,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,to n or something yeah or
19556,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19557,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,to p n which is like periods
19558,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19559,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,and<ts>  n is years
19560,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19561,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,which is like it's interesting
19562,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,it's the classic equation
19563,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,exactly yeah so like we started off with that
19564,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,bless you
19565,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,um so we started off with that we did uh<ts>  we star then we did like we're doing more with cash we did more of with class cash flows
19566,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19567,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,so like<ts>  um like figuring out<ts>  kind of like how to compare investments based on your cash flow<ts>  which is pretty interesting that's a more equations basically
19568,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,mhm
19569,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,um<ts>  now or we just finished<ts>  this thing called n p v and i r r which is like<ts>  n p v is net present value
19570,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,yeah
19571,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,and i r is<ts>  something rate of return investment return
19572,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,is
19573,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,probably<ts>  um and so that's like that helps with like evaluating investments it's pretty interesting
19574,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,interesting
19575,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,um<ts>  yeah like it we're moving onto bonds now which i think would be really cool we talked about like bond pricing um and like just the bond markets
19576,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,is it a lot of work for intro to finance
19577,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,let's see we've had the first problem set was like the easiest thing i've ever done
19578,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,you've only had one then

19659,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,um it's like racquetball except like the ball is smaller it's like tennis inside like inside a room
19660,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,what made you get into the ra um squash
19661,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,um my parents just signed me up for it when i was a kid you know like it's really fun i think it's a lot more from than like
19662,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,then tennis
19663,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,tennis cause tennis you have to like walk around and pick up the ball every time
19664,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,that's true you have to run a lot as well
19665,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah<ts>  i mean re squash is like a lot of short movements it's like<ts>  you hit like the room isn't that big so you can run from corner to corner
19666,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,mm
19667,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah
19668,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,how do you like what's like i i'm not familiar with like the how it works like the the matches and like the scoring or like points
19669,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,it it's it's like ping pong score right it's goes to eleven win by two um imagine it's like tennis except like you hit it against the wall
19670,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,wait wait how do you get like score a point against your opponent cause you're both in the same room right
19671,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,if it bounces twice
19672,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,so bounces twice okay
19673,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah so like imagine you're like playing tennis except like both sides of the court are like mirrored on one side
19674,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,mm
19675,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,so like you hit the ball against the wall like imagine that's like going across the court and then it bounces off and then your opponent has to hit it back onto the wall
19676,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,when you hit it though you have to like step aside for your opponent to c
19677,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,well yeah there's like enough room you do you don't want to hit it to yourself otherwise you'll get like a point off
19678,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,aye<ts>  do you that means you can also can you guys like add spins to your shots or like
19679,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah
19680,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,okay
19681,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,i mean and you can hit it off the side walls and the back wall<ts>  and like there's like ba lines to make sure which which parts of the wall are out
19682,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,oh okay that makes sense seven okay
19683,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah
19684,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,sounds like fun
19685,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,it is fun
19686,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,and played it do we have a squash court here

19707,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,i haven't been paying attention for weeks like i haven't paid attention to it since the last exam
19708,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,i missed two lectures dude i'm like dying
19709,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,uh i have to like i think i have to read i'm gonna read the entire like hundred pages of the textbook this weekend
19710,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,was it more helpful to read a textbook or just
19711,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,the textbook is like really helpful for me i mean i haven't like the the the little bit that i've read is like very helpful cause i thought the first exam was pretty easy
19712,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,mhm
19713,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,and then like this one i don't know any of the contents so i have to learn it
19714,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,like i wasn't the last basically everything on the slides
19715,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah but the last one was like
19716,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,in a sense
19717,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,i mean the slides i don't think are very hopeful i don't find them helpful
19718,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,alright fair enough so y i generally i'm too lazy to read so i i usually hope on the slides
19719,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah same<ts>  usually i don't but i like i think the slides this for this um content are like not helpful
19720,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,that makes sense i think yeah
19721,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,cause i look at them and i'm like what is going on
19722,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,oh yeah that's true cause he explains most of it in the lecture
19723,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah i mean there are recordings i think on trunk of his l lectures but like i think i'm just gonna try reading it cause the the textbook is like like w it's written in a way that like helps you out cause like the author's like i know this is hard like i know this confusing but like let me explain it like a certain way
19724,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,mm makes sense yeah seems like this this time around it's more computational which is annoying
19725,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,i like seriously don't know anything like i i go through lab and like i didn't sit with someone and they like tell me honestly answer

19757,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,that's cool
19758,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,i think it's it's like interesting
19759,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,it is cool
19760,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,gives her an like a cat like look i think
19761,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,i haven't been to her office hours or anything

19778,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,that's strange
19779,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,i feel like
19780,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,we're in the same psych lab
19781,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,i know
19782,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,and we live in the same dorm
19783,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,we ma must be in all the same classes
19784,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,that's so strange
19785,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,we went to the same
19786,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,wait what other classes are you in
19787,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,um i take linguistics um chinese three stat<ts>  i whenever people ask me what classes i take i always forget at least one
19788,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,no that happens to me too i don't know why
19789,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,oh god i have to like go to my sche oh comp sci comp eleven and
19790,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,comp sci
19791,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,oh what's the last one<ts>  this always happens<ts>  um<ts>  music theory music theory
19792,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,music theory
19793,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah
19794,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,linguistics and music theory<ts>  is there a ken jao in your class
19795,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,in which class music theory
19796,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,in either linguistics or music theory
19797,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,linguistics i don't know anybody cause i don't go to class<ts>  i mean it's it's like<ts>  i say that stat like the stuff that we learn is like pretty like esoteric and like not useful but like linguistics is like on a whole nother level of useless
19798,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,oh<ts>  it's
19799,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,and like it's if you ever wanted to know what like the the bilabial valer like tract of your like tongue is then like take linguistics otherwise do not
19800,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,what what is that
19801,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,it's like it's in i thought it was gonna be cool like if you learn like the different parts of like language and meaning and stuff like that but like a lot of it is just like random information that you like
19802,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,wait it's just the intro
19803,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah
19804,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,okay okay
19805,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,but like it's way more like the not theory based but like memorizing like names of parts of like speech and stuff
19806,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,mm that's fair
19807,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,than i was expecting
19808,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,would you feel like maybe if you went to like a higher like level linguistics it'd be m more interesting
19809,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,i mean
19810,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,probably
19811,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,i don't know cause if this is intro then like
19812,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,cause i feel like more m
19813,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,you have to build on those
19814,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,cause i feel like most intro classes are like very general or like broadish
19815,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah exactly that's why it's like really specific
19816,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,so it's like kind of boring<ts>  s oh
19817,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,i i'd like it's if it was general i think i would enjoy it more actually
19818,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,oh okay oh it's not general oh okay
19819,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,no
19820,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,nevermind then
19821,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah<ts>  i mean it it's required for cbs majors
19822,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah i've hard my friend's also cbs how's comp sci eleven treating you
19823,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,uh did i mention that i hate my life i hate my classes um it's like it's it's not bad honestly i i'm doing pretty well so<ts>  it's just all the homeworks take forever
19824,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah i heard that too
19825,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah
19826,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,it's hellish
19827,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,as long as i make through comp fifteen if i can't make it through then then i have to like totally change everything
19828,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,oh my god
19829,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,my life cause comp fifteen and i'm like worried cause after that you ta you take that you take like one hundred level course in comp sci and then like you don't have to take anymore for cbs<ts>  yeah
19830,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,well damn<ts>  comp sci wait which one's like the the hard like super hard comp sci class
19831,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,comp forty
19832,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,comp forty yeah that's it
19833,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah
19834,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,you don't
19835,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,and comp fifteen's supposed to be pretty hard too
19836,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,damn wait you do you have to take comp forty too or no no
19837,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,no
19838,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,alright<ts>  that's good
19839,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah
19840,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,that's good
19841,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,and if i don't if i decide to like if i can't handle comp fifteen i could just minor and you don't need to take comp fifteen
19842,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,holy shit
19843,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,huh
19844,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,wait w what made you want to be a cbs major
19845,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,um i mean i thought about psychology but then like i kind of wanted to like diversify you know<ts>  so<ts>  yeah basically and comp sci's like pretty interesting i like it
19846,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah it's pretty interesting
19847,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,and i'm thinking about like pre law stuff so
19848,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,pre law
19849,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah
19850,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,there isn't a pre law cour<ts>  no no
19851,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,there's like i took um
19852,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,doesn't that mean you just have to prepare for like the the bar and everything
19853,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah
19854,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,on your own
19855,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,and the lsat yeah um i took sociology of law<ts>  and there's like a couple like random law classes there's like philosophy of law<ts>  and then like business law<ts>  and stuff
19856,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,a lot of law
19857,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,i haven't taken the like you l apparently like you don't really have to take law related stuff before you go to law school which is like kinda worrisome cause like i don't know if i really like it until i go to law school and like if i go to law school and i don't like it then like what do you do
19858,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,that's true
19859,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah
19860,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,lawyers
19861,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,lawyers<ts>  cbs is supposed to be a good like pre major if you're or major undergraduate major if you're looking for law stuff
19862,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,wait why why is it so
19863,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,cause just like psychology and then like you have to take logic and stuff
19864,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,oh
19865,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,for cbs so
19866,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,okay
19867,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,you're like that<ts>  although i'm like<ts>  debating about like the importance cause like law school like gpa and your lsat score are like the number one most important things so like i'm not sure if i should like switch out of cbs to like an easier major so that i can have a high gpa cause there's like cause the apparently like law schools don't care like what's where what your what you did in undergrad as long as your grades are high<ts>  like there's like they they'd rather take like a four point oh in like film and media studies over like a three point four in like engineering or something
19868,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,that's<ts>  that's odd why is that
19869,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,cause like i mean i think it's just like the schools like want want the higher rankings from like their a their average gpa is high so they get more money you know
19870,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,wow
19871,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah
19872,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,that's
19873,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,it's like i'd say i think it's like i it's nice cause it's not as like subjective as like choosing a undergraduate college cause like it's just like pure like gpa and lsat but like kinda sucks
19874,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,that's true favor the easier hm
19875,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah<ts>  what is med med school like what's the process i don't know anything i have like one doctor friend
19876,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,well
19877,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,do you know
19878,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,um i should probably should research into more of it i know that starting from next year should prepare for the<ts>  well i should technically i should ish prepare like right kinda like slight prepare right now for the mcat<ts>  and then you you take the fucking test and then you apply it to a bunch of schools and hope you get in
19879,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah i mean i had like an existential crisis while i was studying comp for my exam i had an exam yesterday i was like instead of studying i was like looking up like law school statistics<ts>  and stuff like i was like what do i do with my life
19880,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah<ts>  no don't do that<ts>  yeah look up the stats for getting into med school i'm like yeah i'm scared
19881,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah<ts>  um yeah<ts>  some rough careers
19882,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah<ts>  it's worrying<ts>  how long you reckon it's been already
19883,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,oh yeah i don't even know what time is it
19884,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,the walk here was really long
19885,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah and i i d i went to the wrong place
19886,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yes same i thought it'd be
19887,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,in the psych building
19888,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,closer
19889,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,but i guess the set up isn't in the psych building
19890,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah this is too legit
19891,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,it's two forty two<ts>  so when did we get here you got here at like two twenty
19892,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,mm
19893,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,so like
19894,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,that's fair
19895,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,been like fifteen twenty minutes<ts>  what an engaging conversation
19896,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,i know right totally<ts>  wait w what's the purpose of u with them recording to us again i forgot
19897,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,they're like gonna analyze our like social uh cues and like gestures and ga like i don't know
19898,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,oh like our body language and what we do

19900,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,huh oh shit
19901,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,cause i don't think<ts>  i mean i guess they are they don't they do care about the content of the conversation but<ts>  it's mostly like social i took social psych freshman year so like<ts>  i feel like i should know more

19920,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,and then like
19921,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,and then world civ
19922,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,what counts as a world civ again do culture classes count
19923,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah
19924,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,i like get those i think i get those done like mm soon ish<ts>  cause i think they also count for like towards your language right if you take like four courses of a language and then two courses of a culture
19925,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah i think i i mean i kinda screwed up cause i thought i would be jun done with chinese last semester but like i i apparently they don't count like together i took like i took chinese cinema freshman year
19926,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,mhm
19927,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,and then chinese one and two and i thought that was it cause i took french i'd passed out of three semesters of french so that would been six total semesters but like apparently you have to get to at least chinese three before<ts>  cause you need like three semesters of two languages to pass out
19928,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,oh
19929,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,but then like now i can use the chinese cinema as my world civ so i'm done with that
19930,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,but and after world civ there's natural sciences<ts>  which i<ts>  probably don't need to worry about
19931,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah<ts>  yeah
19932,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,cause i took like f jesus christ
19933,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah<ts>  you're gonna take like fifty<ts>  and then<ts>  and like social sciences humanities and arts
19934,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,what counts as a social science again<ts>  i don't remember
19935,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,it's like psychology sociology
19936,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,oh yep that's definitely done soon
19937,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah
19938,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,arts
19939,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,and math there's math also
19940,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,oh fuck man that's sta don't doesn't stats counts as math
19941,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,i think this counts as math yeah
19942,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah t this counts
19943,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,well this i mean our the class that we're both in
19944,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah<ts>  art classes
19945,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,oh
19946,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,alright i t i'm considering taking psychology of music i think it counts as both like a psych class
19947,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,yeah i think i might take that next semester
19948,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,it it doesn't count as psych and as a art class
19949,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,i think so
19950,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,oh yeah
19951,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,and like i'm thinking about minoring in music

20083,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,i think that's the rumor<ts>  i mean like but it doesn't seem like the kind of vibe
20084,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,cause like
20085,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,like the move like the trailers the stuff seems like very like guardians of the the galaxy kind of

20253,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,okay literally in class today like cause i just went to the class the first time this morning and like my brother and his friend are literally just like on their phones in the back full time and i'm like taking notes like right nice and brother's like laughing at me and um but so he would literally like show us like a single frame of a movie and he would be like look at how like you know there's like the spot of light that was like position during the credit sequence like it changed and like it wouldn't naturally be reflected but it's reflected anyway or something or like so what are your guys thoughts on that what do you think and i'm like<ts>  i have no fucking idea<ts>  and like
20254,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,and your brother's like um lacrosse
20255,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,he wasn't even no he's smart guy he's but he's just you know it's a film class or whatever
20256,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,in that class not paying attention
20257,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,yeah um but like all these people are raising
20258,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,is it an art credit
20259,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,i don't think so
20260,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,mm
20261,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,i wish it was all these people are like raising their hands and like oh it's like the difference between like this spectral reality and i'm like how did you get any of that like i don't know but it's i've always wanted to take a film class so
20262,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,mm<ts>  that is cool
20263,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,i still might drop it cause it's so awk wait did i tell you how awkward and how much social anxiety i had when i was like trying to figure this out cause i like i literally emailed him like the professor and i was like hey like i just added this class what do i need to do to catch up and also i may drop it like really soon because i'm not sure about like my other commitments yet
20264,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,mm
20265,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,and so i like made up all the stuff whatever i came to the class and i like introduced myself to him after class which i was proud of myself for doing cause i never do stuff like that
20266,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,yeah<ts>  yeah
20267,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,i'm like so antisocial i was just gonna leave it but like i should just do this but h i like now it's even more awkward if i drop it because he like totally knows who am
20268,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,yeah<ts>  why would you drop it
20269,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,it's my fifth class and like
20270,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,oh because it's a fifth class
20271,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,depending on my other commitments or whatever and how cause literally the only reason i'm taking it's like for interest it's not like fulfilling anything for me i'm pretty sure it's not an art credit so
20272,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,oh what else are you taking
20273,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,all my classes are this is what wait did i tell you about my whole crisis that like maybe i'm stupid
20274,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,no
20275,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,of like all the classes i take or what everyone else considers like easy classes
20276,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,no but you're in one that linguistics that you're like this is fairly hard
20277,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,yeah but like i feel like in general like people consider all the class that i take is like bullshit classes because they're like humanities or whatever
20278,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,that means nothing
20279,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,anyway um
20280,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,most engineers might be able to take a humanities class and like most engineers say that a humanities class is actually really hard
20281,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,okay
20282,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,like they're looking for the easy one
20283,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,yeah i mean i don't know
20284,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,quote quote
20285,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,i feel like some people were in the classroom other like oh this is so whatever but anyway<ts>  yeah i'm in like creative writing a philosophy class called nothingness<ts>  which is like super out there
20286,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,right right<ts>  yeah
20287,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,right with darren<ts>  actually me and darren had so much fun
20288,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,that dinner was fun yeah
20289,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,wait we actually had so much fun in that class after we were literally like um he like did all these drawings in my no cause they were having like technical difficulties with playing like the m videos and stuff so we were just like chilling and so he was like drawing all these weird drawing in my notebook and we were like writing like weird poetry in our notebooks and like writing notes and stuff it's actually really fun
20290,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,that's fun
20291,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,um but yeah what was i saying okay yeah nothingness creative writing<ts>  now i'm in this film class stats and this linguistics
20292,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,they sound that's a lot
20293,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,i just like suddenly got really insecure about like
20294,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,in yeah
20295,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,because you know last year i was like oh like you know getting to college i was like oh no it's gonna be like hard to do well and i was like oh i'm actually doing well but now i'm re like oh okay i'm doing well but it's in these like classes that people considerable bullshit
20296,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,mm
20297,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,and like when i'm actually taking a class like romance linguistics i'm like i have no idea what's going on
20298,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,cause they're hard
20299,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,yeah<ts>  but i've realized i need to just like study for that class i can't just do the readings i have to like go back and know it
20300,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,that's annoying
20301,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,cause you live through it like you have to know like the tongue like position when you say like ul or whatever and like
20302,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,yeah they but i remember we had a a person come in to cbs last year
20303,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,so many like technical
20304,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,and try teaching that stuff and i was like what<ts>  i don't
20305,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,in cbs
20306,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,cognitive brain science yeah
20307,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,uh huh
20308,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,stats is actually seemingly okay it just is fine
20309,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,everyone said it was gonna be really easy but then someone i talked to said like it's not as easy as everyone says like they said towards the it gets hard
20310,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,yeah it'll probably get harder cause stats does get harder but right now it's like been fine
20311,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,yeah but also another thing was like in that la
20312,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,i can't
20313,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,and everyone else had already finished like people finished like two hours before me
20314,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,mine lasted two<ts>  no mine lasted two and a half hours we couldn't just lea

21130,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,because people go sixty on it
21131,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,oh the first ticket on that i mean the first accident on that road
21132,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,and that intersection<ts>  well that intersection specifically<ts>  because that st i don't know what's wrong with that intersection
21133,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,why don't they just fix the intersection so people stop crashing
21134,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,i don't know but so i didn't even get a ticket i like cause they're just like yeah
21135,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,saso happy that everyone w fine
21136,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,well that and then also just like it's a really bad intersection and what else well like worst case scenario well there are two things that could have happened one is i pulled out an oncoming car could have come
21137,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,yeah i've heard of that happening
21138,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,and like hit me in the door<ts>  that would've been t that would've been
21139,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,especially if the car came onto your driver's side
21140,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,no right cause like it was like this like this his road oncoming me
21141,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,hm
21142,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,so if i pulled out like
21143,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,then the people would have come
21144,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,boom i would have died and then also if it was like half a second sooner i would have hit him in his door but i was going like twenty five miles an hour like i was not going remotely fast i was also lost so i was driving really slow and then if i had also gone half a second later i would have completely cleared the intersection so then it's just like one of those like things and i would just always been like oh my god like thats so scary and like never talk about it ever again but<ts>  yeah
21145,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,well that's scary
21146,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,yeah it was terrible and then what else i've just gotten in like baby accidents that i haven't even been driving like one time my dad and i were sitting at a stop light and it was like my first day of school at like my like original like catholic high school and some guy just like literally like rammed into us

22084,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,cause it's so bad
22085,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,i know<ts>  like some video on youtube described it like it's like if an alien w like if you showed an alien and explained an al to an alien like what movies are but and like the alien tried to make one without knowing what a movie a without like actually understanding like how movie like is like why movie can be like how a successful movie operates it's just like you explain like oh a movie needs plot like characters it needs some plot it needs like a setting

22091,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,oh my god
22092,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,so to translate it again back into the original it's just like not
22093,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,yeah like whatever whatever this is is like not like i don't even know
22094,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,but i heard like<ts>  i heard like the guy who directed it was like this he had like a weird backstory
22095,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,ye no like
22096,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,he was like a model
22097,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,yeah i i don't know it's like tommy was those like
22098,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,yeah
22099,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,like nobody knows like what we're he's from like
22100,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,yeah
22101,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,exa it's he's just like showed up one day and like<ts>  he had money and to make a movie
22102,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,he had money he had a weird accent
22103,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,yeah
22104,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,that no one really knows where it came from
22105,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,i know like it's like<ts>  it's like low key shady as hell
22106,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,yeah but yeah you know as an actor you probably do need some money
22107,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,mm that's true<ts>  i won i feel like that those actors the rest of the actors are probably like i can't believe i've like participa y i believe i believe i i can't believe i participated in this
22108,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,i can't believe i'm doing this
22109,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,r rip my career
22110,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,yeah<ts>  but they got into it right like they
22111,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,i don't i mean i feel like
22112,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,like they acted seriously
22113,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,the other actors weren't even like that good though
22114,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,yeah cause they were the people that couldn't get other roles
22115,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,i don't know it's like like they're not good actors
22116,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,yeah
22117,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,and the fact that they were in the room only made it made like later on worse i guess
22118,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,have you seen the disaster artist
22119,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,no but it's like
22120,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,it's pretty good
22121,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,it's so slow to explain the backstory right
22122,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,mm yeah it's like based on like<ts>  the guy who is his friend who like co did stuff with him um it's like based on his biography
22123,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,oh
22124,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,yeah
22125,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,so i guess like
22126,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,cause he like wrote about it
22127,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,like so i guess there's like some but i mean obviously like the friend probably like hid a bunch of stuff
22128,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,yeah
22129,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,so i guess like we don't like have the entire truth
22130,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,yeah<ts>  still doesn't make sense
22131,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,mhm
22132,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,even if we had the entire truth
22133,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,that's true to be fair like a lot of directors make like interesting choices
22134,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,yeah yeah
