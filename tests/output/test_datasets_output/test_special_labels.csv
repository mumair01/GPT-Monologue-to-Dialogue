2107,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> friends and <SP2>
2108,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and like we watch the commercials <SP1>
2109,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yes the commercials that's my favorite part i watched last last years was fun and it was literally just me and my parents i like m my friends were like having like a little superbowl party i was like i wanna watch with my family <SP2>
2110,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> aw <SP1>
2111,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> which is kind of lame but it's fine i it was fun though <SP2>
2112,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i hate sitting in silence during the like during anything <SP1>
2113,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
2114,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> that's fair <SP2>
2115,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and so i always ask a lot of questions during any tv <SP1>
2116,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> me too <SP2>
2117,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and it bothers my f dad so much <SP1>
2118,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh my god my sister hates that like w w w w we we started she's watching grey's anatomy like over break and she this is her second time watching it because <SP2>
2119,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> of course <SP1>
2120,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> w i mean why not and so occasionally my parents would walk in and then just start asking questions and you could see her just start fuming and it was so funny <SP2>
2121,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i would do that with movies though and it'd be like those action movies where you don't really know who's good or who's bad until the end <SP1>
2122,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and i would always ask during during the first like five minutes who's good and like oh is he a good guy and my dad'd be like i'm watching the movie for the first time as well like <SP1>
2123,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh <SP2>
2124,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> what do you want from me <SP1>
2125,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh my gosh <SP2>
2126,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2127,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> i wish i watched more movies <SP2>
2128,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> do you watch movies <SP2>
2129,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i had so much time last semester with my schedule i had enough time to watch two movies a day and hang out with people at night <SP1>
2130,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> what <SP2>
2131,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i mean i didn't watch two movies a day but like i had time <SP1>
2132,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> wait wh what was your schedule like <SP2>
2133,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> um my only rigorous class was computer science and then my other classes were like philosophy uh my memory class <SP1>
2134,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> wait oh is that an ex college class <SP2>
2135,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> french <SP1>
2136,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> did you like that <SP2>
2137,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> um it was super reading intensive <SP1>
2138,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and i think that the professor knew that it was really reading intensive <SP1>
2139,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> really <SP2>
2140,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> but he took all of our like i guess halfway through the ex college is this thing where you give feedback <SP1>
2141,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh really that's cool <SP2>
2142,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i think we all did that oh no wait i didn't do that in any of my other classes yeah so the ex college would give them feedback and then he was a dissertation candidate <SP1>
2143,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh that's cool <SP2>
2144,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> so <SP1>
2145,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah and so he was writing his dissertation on what he was teaching us <SP1>
2146,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh that's super cool <SP2>
2147,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> in class yeah and so i guess a lot of our topics like a lot of the stuff we discussed in class he would then write up later in his dissertation <SP1>
2148,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh that's so cool <SP2>
2149,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> which was cool yeah um and then so it's read really reading intensive and but he like laid off a bit at the end <SP1>
2150,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
2151,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and i don't know it kinda got like weird in the middle where i felt like we were just doing the same thing over and over again <SP1>
2152,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> but then at the end we did that super cool project where i was like blacking up a newspaper <SP1>
2153,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> i didn't see you do that <SP2>
2154,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> what <SP2>
2155,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> oh yeah so our last project was we had to create a um memory narrative out of any no we had to take a memory narrative and create um our own like piece of art so we could do like write a musical create songs <SP1>
2156,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> what did you do <SP2>
2157,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> poems <SP1>
2158,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> so we were in groups and my group our theme was like creating a new memory narrative from an old one <SP1>
2159,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh <SP2>
2160,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> using blackout poetry <SP1>
2161,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> but because i don't do poetry i created a story out of um you know the new york times l uh modern love section <SP1>
2162,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh <SP2>
2163,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> sure <SP2>
2164,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> it's like people write in and they c write in like love stories from their life <SP1>
2165,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> we'll go with it <SP2>
2166,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> aw <SP2>
2167,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and so <SP1>
2168,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> that's so cute <SP2>
2169,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah and so every year around thanksgiving they publish like a section about it so there and this year was like the thirteenth anniversary or something so they had a bunch of stories from past years new ones and then also like little things that people had written and like vignettes or like thirteen word love stories and it's like <SP1>
2170,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> aw <SP2>
2171,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah it was really cute and it's my favorite section so my mom pulled it out for me over like when it came in the mail <SP1>
2172,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> did she mail it to you <SP2>
2173,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh wait why do <SP2>
2174,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> no when i went home for thanksgiving i got it from her <SP1>
2175,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh okay i remember you talking about this but like v briefly <SP2>
2176,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2177,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and so i took the secti s most people just took like a little article or like a page from a book and bl did blackout poetry but i took like the full new york times section <SP1>
2178,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh that's so cool <SP2>
2179,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and i blacked out <SP1>
2180,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i blacked everything every article got blacked out to create a different love story out of all the love stories in the section <SP1>
2181,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> that's so cute <SP2>
2182,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> it was so fun and then at the end i got to read it out loud which was fun um so i think that that a ability to like express myself artistically was something that the class gave me that all my other classes didn't <SP1>
2183,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yeah that's fair <SP2>
2184,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> like computers science i was not <SP1>
2185,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> artistic <SP2>
2186,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> being artistic <SP1>
2187,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> really <SP2>
2188,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i mean sundays i spend all day in office hours so you know <SP1>
2189,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> which you're not gonna do today <SP2>
2190,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> no i'm max staying till three <SP1>
2191,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> i was gonna say you need to give yourself a time limit <SP2>
2192,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i think <SP1>
2193,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> because you will stay <SP2>
2194,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i will <SP1>
2195,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> cause then i'll be like someone will start saying something and i'll be like oo that's good <SP1>
2196,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> d i remember <SP2>
2197,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i should stay to listen to that <SP1>
2198,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> i know i went to office hours for calc <SP2>
2199,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> what day was that oh my gosh friday because i couldn't go to lift <SP2>
2200,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> cause i was sick <SP2>
2201,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> right right right <SP1>
2202,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> and i was just sitting there and there was like three people there it was a little awkward cause we were all sitting like facing away from each other at different tables <SP2>
2203,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> it was very strange <SP2>
2204,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> okay <SP1>
2205,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> but he was like explaining something that i'd already done and done right but he was explaining it on the board and i was like i need to listen to this and i was like do i have to listen to this <SP2>
2206,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2207,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> like i did it right but i listened anyway it was helpful <SP2>
2208,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2209,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> it was actually really helpful because now i know how to do the problem set <SP2>
2210,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> amazing what happens when you ask questions <SP2>
2211,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> so helpful <SP1>
2212,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2213,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> but yeah <SP2>
2214,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i have to go do that for my discrete math class t tomorrow <SP1>
2215,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh you're in discrete too <SP2>
2216,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i'm not in the class nicole is in <SP1>
2217,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yeah you're are you in the comp sci department <SP2>
2218,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and it's so much better <SP1>
2219,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> that's what i've heard it did rayna say that <SP2>
2220,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i h <SP1>
2221,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> did rayna tell you that <SP2>
2222,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> no i only did it becau well i wanted to be in the ma to take it in the math department but it was full and like after the engineers picked and then maybe like two pick times into freshmen day it was totally full <SP1>
2223,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh right <SP2>
2224,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and because it's like a class <SP1>
2225,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> whereas the comp sci one is a lecture <SP1>
2226,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh <SP2>
2227,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> interesting okay <SP2>
2228,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and i i like the professor for the comp sci one better <SP1>
2229,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> that's good <SP2>
2230,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> so i have her for two classes this semester <SP1>
2231,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> who's the professor <SP2>
2232,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> wait are you in comp fifteen <SP2>
2233,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> lynne <SP1>
2234,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh <SP2>
2235,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> are you wait so are you thinking about comp sci like for i feel like you like it <SP2>
2236,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> n no <SP1>
2237,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> you're good at it <SP2>
2238,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i'm ver mm no i'm very much considering dropping comp fifteen right now <SP1>
2239,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> really <SP2>
2240,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i just the homeworks are super super hard to understand for me <SP1>
2241,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
2242,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and i spend so much time like agonizing over it and thinking about it and not knowing how to do it <SP1>
2243,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> mhm that's fair <SP2>
2244,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> that it takes up time from everything else that's why i'm like alright i'll look it over on friday like after we get it <SP1>
2245,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
2246,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i probably won't do anything on saturday and sunday spend a whole day doing it <SP1>
2247,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> do you have <SP2>
2248,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh my brain just went out the window wait oh oh do you have five classes is what i was gonna ask oh so if you drop it <SP2>
2249,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> so i can drop one <SP1>
2250,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
2251,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> alright what do you what other classes <SP2>
2252,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> comp fifteen discrete french three which is so much work <SP1>
2253,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> are you in that with rachel <SP2>
2254,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> no she's in french two <SP1>
2255,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> okay <SP2>
2256,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> no um my professor last semester was super sweet and knew everything we knew and like was so great about speaking to us in fre it was like a good proportion of french speaking to english speaking so she was under explaining <SP1>
2257,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
2258,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and she talked in like a manner that a french two student should understand <SP1>
2259,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> okay <SP2>
2260,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> like fa like slow but like fast enough that like we knew what the language was about <SP1>
2261,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
2262,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and then french three was a totally different professor <SP1>
2263,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> was it like fluent <SP2>

2360,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> uh wait <SP1>
2361,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> how long okay <SP2>
2362,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> hold on <SP1>
2363,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> cause i wanna do both <SP2>
2364,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> um <SP1>

2371,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> it's five <SP1>
2372,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> fi yeah it's five for tuesday then is it eleven or four <SP2>
2373,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> four <SP1>
2374,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> four <SP2>
2375,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i don't know <SP1>
2376,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> okay okay <SP2>
2377,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> it's on my schedule <SP1>
2378,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> it's fine i know i have it on my computer i just keeping track of things is a lot and also like we have to read so <SP2>
2379,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> i told you about my greece class and how we have blog posts due every friday <SP2>
2380,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2381,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> and i read it to you because i was stressed <SP2>
2382,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2383,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> um what was i gonna say so like the re the blog post is technically due friday and it was on the reading that was technically due tomorrow so i already did the reading for tomorrow for greece but i wanna do the reading that's wednesday but i like don't know what it is the syllabus is kind of unclear i mean i'm sure there's a link to it but i think it's some kind of poem like a shorter poem ed as opposed to like the epic poems <SP2>
2384,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> right right right right right <SP1>
2385,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> that we've been reading <SP2>
2386,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> so i have to figure that out but i wanna do the psych reading first <SP2>
2387,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i think that you should stop taking notes and just start reading it <SP1>
2388,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> but i also have to finish my lab <SP2>
2389,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> like it just makes sense like logically if you just read it that makes sense <SP1>
2390,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yeah no i know it makes sense but i'm <SP2>
2391,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> it'll take such a short amount a time <SP1>
2392,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> i know <SP2>
2393,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh i started like taking notes a little differently <SP2>
2394,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> okay <SP1>
2395,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> like instead of like taking notes as i go i'll like read a page and then like jot down a few things after i read the page <SP2>
2396,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah yeah yeah <SP1>
2397,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> and then do that instead of like really super intense note taking <SP2>
2398,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> right <SP1>
2399,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> but um <SP2>
2400,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> but yeah i have to i wanted to type up my lectures from like the past few weeks but i don't think that's gonna happen <SP2>
2401,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> not a priority <SP1>
2402,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> not a priority exactly so i think what i'm gonna do is instead of typing them up as i go like that'll be my studying is like typing up my lectures because there's just no way to do it as i go if i like <SP2>
2403,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2404,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> it's really just impossible this semester <SP2>
2405,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> which is not ideal but it's fine i guess <SP2>
2406,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2407,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> uh i have to i do have to outline my lecture for tomorrow for chem though <SP2>
2408,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> very nice <SP1>

2414,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> well <SP1>
2415,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i think that she is supposed to pour today <SP1>
2416,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> that's good <SP2>

2582,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> but i don't know then they'll house me <SP1>
2583,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
2584,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> but i don't know if i'm gonna live in the same like they might put me in a different and then i'd have to move myself <SP1>
2585,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> r yeah you might put your own <SP2>
2586,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and like <SP1>

2610,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yeah it's just not a very conducive space size <SP2>
2611,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> no one would care <SP1>
2612,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2613,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> the riot proof walls man they're not super yoga <SP2>

2616,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2617,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> those the walls are so weird i'm excited to live next year somewhere where the halls are straight because then like when you walk out of your room you can see other people <SP2>
2618,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2619,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> and not just like a wall <SP2>
2620,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and not startl oh i startle myself every single time <SP1>
2621,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> i did i scare you coming out of the bathroom the other day <SP2>
2622,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> was that you or was it somebody else i like really scared somebody walking out of bathroom <SP2>
2623,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> it was probably me i don't reme oh yeah it was me <SP1>
2624,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and then i like when i was you like collapsed on the ground laughing and coughing <SP1>
2625,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
2626,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> probably <SP2>
2627,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2628,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> sounds about right <SP2>
2629,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yesterday someone was outside my room talking and i was like i wonder who that is but i was like i don't care enough to look and then i had to go to the bathroom so like opened my door to the bathroom and this person was just standing like right in front my door reading the like puns <SP1>

2632,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> i didn't even think about that <SP2>
2633,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> well cause here's the thing this is another interesting little happening on our hall your room is directly in front of the the bathroom <SP2>
2634,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> hello <SP1>
2635,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> my rooms hidden some people don't even know we exist <SP2>
2636,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yes <SP1>
2637,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2638,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> so i never encounter that but you probably encounter people all the time just like chillin by your door and <SP2>
2639,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> is it weird <SP2>
2640,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> it's so annoying at night <SP1>
2641,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yeah i'm really i really wanna know happened last night <SP2>

2643,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> they like hold the door open to talk <SP1>
2644,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> ugh <SP2>
2645,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and then my room is like <SP1>
2646,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> right there <SP1>
2647,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> you could hear you could hear everything <SP2>
2648,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i hear everything <SP1>
2649,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> also <SP2>
2650,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> like people bi people complain in the bathroom all the time <SP1>

2658,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh yeah you're so close <SP2>
2659,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and it's all i hear <SP1>
2660,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> we only hear like we hear the toilets flushing and sometimes the showers which is kind of nice because then you know if the shower's being used <SP2>
2661,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> although recently i haven't been able to hear it i don't know why <SP2>
2662,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i just go in and i'm like hey are those showers being used guys <SP1>
2663,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yeah it's just like that extra walk to the bathrooms <SP2>

2666,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> or that time that i was going to the shower and s and sophia was coming from down the hall saw me about to go in ran to beat me <SP1>
2667,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> really wait i didn't know <SP2>
2668,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> not not blonde sophia um sophia valeria's roommate <SP1>
2669,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh gotcha <SP2>
2670,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and this was like in the th second week of school i was like wow <SP1>
2671,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> that's so funny <SP2>
2672,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i was like dripping in sweat after a marathon run like i clearly needed a shower <SP1>
2673,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> aw <SP2>
2674,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and she just ran to beat me and then t proceeded to take a forty five minute shower <SP1>
2675,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh no <SP2>
2676,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> so i sat in my desk chair with the door open waiting in my towel and she came out and i was like <SP1>
2677,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> that's so funny <SP2>

2679,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> how did she beat you from down the hall <SP2>
2680,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> you live across from the bathroom <SP2>
2681,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> not do like no no no like um <SP1>

2689,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> so like i couldn't move fast <SP1>
2690,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and she just like race walked ahead <SP1>
2691,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> that's so funny <SP2>
2692,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and like <SP1>
2693,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> that's fair though i mean the sh i never like i always shower at weird ti weird times because like i just shower after lift between class but now i shower at like night because we have practice so late but i feel like i haven't had to wait that long for shower ever because i'm not showering at peak shower time <SP2>
2694,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> peak shower time <SP1>
2695,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> but yeah i i have mad like respect for people who could um shower before class before their eight thirties <SP2>
2696,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> some people have to do it like they're like i must shower in the morning like <SP1>
2697,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> which is fair i think <SP2>
2698,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i'm a night showerer <SP1>
2699,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> i'm a night showerer too also because i work out during the day i feel like it's pointless to shower before <SP2>
2700,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and also like when i get in my bed i want to be clean <SP1>
2701,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> but <SP2>
2702,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> like i don't like the idea that like i'm getting in my bed with today's germs on <SP1>
2703,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yes i that's how i feel <SP2>
2704,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yes i feel that way too i don't like to sit in my bed until i've showered <SP2>
2705,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2706,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> which like i'll i'll do it but i don't like too <SP2>
2707,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> like i'll sit on the bed but not like <SP1>
2708,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> but not in yeah yeah especially if i'm sweaty oo nope i can't do it <SP2>
2709,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> it's okay <SP1>
2710,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> i'm tired <SP2>
2711,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i really don't want to go to office hours today <SP1>
2712,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> i don't blame you <SP2>
2713,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> but i haven't done any of the work like i just don't know how <SP1>
2714,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> is it this is comp fifteen <SP2>
2715,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> it's not like i yeah it's not like i i n have the work where i'm you know what if i go to office hours it will just be like a little easier it's like i have to go because i have no idea how to do the work <SP1>
2716,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yeah what is what is what are you doing <SP2>
2717,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> it's an expansion o have you ever taken computer science at all <SP1>
2718,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> nope i have like zero knowledge of computer science <SP2>
2719,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> it's like <SP1>
2720,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i hadn't last semester too <SP1>
2721,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh okay <SP2>
2722,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> going into comp eleven <SP1>
2723,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> it's they take the last thing that we learned in comp eleven which is um uh data structures like arrays which are like lists <SP1>
2724,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
2725,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> of items and they like make a class out of it <SP1>
2726,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> so it's like all the different types of data structures you can have <SP1>
2727,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh <SP2>
2728,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> interesting <SP2>
2729,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> in computer science <SP1>
2730,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> that sounds hard computer science just sounds hard to me in general cause it seems like it's not it's like a different language which it it is i guess technically <SP2>
2731,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i think it's difficult for me because they give us a week to do the homework <SP1>
2732,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and because it's a lecture style class it's not one on one so like if i have a question like i have to prioritize my questions <SP1>
2733,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yes <SP2>
2734,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> like i can't ask every single question that comes to my head <SP1>
2735,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
2736,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> during lecture and because i can't do that i then forget the question and then i don't remember t that i need to know it <SP1>
2737,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
2738,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> until i'm doing the homework and i'm like i have no idea what this means because i didn't ask that question <SP1>
2739,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
2740,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> but like i can't raise my hand every five minutes <SP1>
2741,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> five minutes <SP2>
2742,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> and be like i have a question <SP1>
2743,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> yeah yeah <SP2>
2744,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> i have question and the other day oh my god the other day in discrete math i raised my hand with a question because she gave gives out handouts and worksheets but at the beginning of the semester she didn't realize how many people were in the class so she didn't make enough <SP1>
2745,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> oh no <SP2>
2746,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP1> so i didn't get one of the first worksheets <SP1>
2747,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> uh huh <SP2>

2765,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> which is fine i think some people <SP2>
2766,2018-02-04-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,2,<SP2> like i get wh why that would be frustrating like i had teachers in high school who would do that and like i loved them and they were great people and i knew that that wasn't in their character it was just like they were frustrated with like people it like wasn't you but it was like other <SP2>

2782,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> this is so weird <SP2>
2783,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> so weird <SP1>
2784,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> wait <SP2>
2785,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> this is it i wonder what the purpose of this set up is <SP2>
2786,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> i feel like to make us like it just makes us like uncomfortable which is weird cause like if they're trying to figure out like <SP1>
2787,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> like normal social interaction <SP2>
2788,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2789,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> so maybe they're not trying to figure out totally normal social in i like this this is like a mirror like do you feel like this will h this thing is weird <SP2>
2790,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> it's so weird <SP1>

2799,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> it's interesting <SP2>
2800,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2801,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i wonder if this lab is just like the purpose is to collect a ton of data but they must they must do something with it <SP2>
2802,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> i don't know <SP1>

2826,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> me too <SP1>
2827,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> like those poor people <SP2>
2828,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2829,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> i i thought that they were gonna say like like tell the person to leave or something <SP1>
2830,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i guess they could do homework <SP2>

2859,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> like yeah <SP2>
2860,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> but i don't know like i the chances of anyone who would care like finding this video and knowing that it's us <SP1>
2861,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> yeah that's such a stretch <SP2>

2899,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> but like we were there ugh i don't know it was weird maybe ugh yeah i they all blended together <SP1>
2900,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
2901,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i'm gonna ask them what the deal with this is when we leave the study <SP2>
2902,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> like interesting <SP2>

2907,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i feel like we're in like um like a dystopian novel or something <SP2>
2908,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> like black mirror <SP2>
2909,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2910,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> oh my god <SP1>
2911,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> we're in an episode of black mirror <SP2>
2912,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> you're gonna scare me <SP1>
2913,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> it's too early for this <SP1>
2914,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i think stranger things is coming back soon isn't it <SP2>
2915,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> maybe <SP1>
2916,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> i don't know <SP1>
2917,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> ka i remember katie was so into it last year and she just like in her typical which is just like scream and like during the whole thing was like crying <SP2>
2918,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> and screaming and yelling and like from her bed and <SP2>
2919,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> oh my god <SP1>

2926,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> and she was like no you have to pay attention <SP2>
2927,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i had such a good instagram caption last halloween <SP2>
2928,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> that was like a reference to stranger things <SP2>
2929,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> what was it <SP1>

2938,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> oh that's good <SP1>
2939,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> oh we can use this time to brainstorm what what my instagram captions are gonna be <SP2>
2940,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> okay well i need to see the picture first <SP1>

2942,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i don't know i don't think i have any really clever captions i think it's gonna be like <SP2>
2943,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i don't know <SP2>
2944,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
2945,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> i just wanna like tag post malone a million times <SP1>
2946,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> in my caption and see if <SP1>
2947,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> and see if he <SP2>
2948,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i saw somebody else who was post malone actually <SP2>
2949,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> who <SP1>
2950,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i don't know somebody that i don't think i knew <SP2>
2951,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> okay from tufts <SP1>
2952,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> no i don't think so <SP2>
2953,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> okay <SP1>
2954,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> she did like the hand tattoos too <SP2>
2955,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> oh <SP1>
2956,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> and it i think she did it in sharpie <SP2>
2957,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> myah <SP1>
2958,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> because it was like very fine point and i was like girl that's gonna be on your face for a long time <SP2>
2959,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> mm <SP1>
2960,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> but it it was like really good but you were better <SP2>
2961,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> thanks <SP1>
2962,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> okay so do you think we can get like a hot beverage on our way out <SP2>
2963,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> like i would imagine i don't know i didn't see anything <SP1>
2964,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i know it's just that tin of cookies in the middle and those don't even look like good cookies <SP2>
2965,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah i feel like those tins like people reuse a lot like who even knows if there were cookies in there <SP1>
2966,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> right <SP2>
2967,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> okay what time is it ten thirty so i guess by the time we get back i could just go to carm <SP2>
2968,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
2969,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i wonder if like other age people participate in this i w i think that just like all of psychology is based off of college psychology students <SP2>
2970,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
2971,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> which i would say is a flaw <SP2>
2972,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2973,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> because i think there's a lot of i mean there's a lot of different people who study psychology but there's also some like similar similarities i feel like in like amongst a lot of people <SP2>
2974,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> definitely <SP1>
2975,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> s <SP2>
2976,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> i know <SP1>
2977,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> so it's like i mean also like it's social psych there's always like a small chapter at the end of each or a small section at the end of each chapter where they're talking about cultural differences and how like <SP2>
2978,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
2979,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> um <SP2>
2980,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> and how <SP2>
2981,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> like that's a thing that we haven't really totally explored yet <SP2>
2982,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
2983,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> but they'll give like a few references to like the few studies that have been done in japan or like canada <SP2>
2984,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
2985,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> which is yeah <SP2>
2986,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i like your out i have my nails painted for so long and then i was like i just wanna have not painted nails <SP2>
2987,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
2988,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> mine i don't know why it just like is already chipping and did it like two days ago but that's fine <SP1>
2989,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> mm yeah <SP2>
2990,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> what can you do <SP2>
2991,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i would love like a spa spa day like a massage <SP2>
2992,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> oh my god <SP1>
2993,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> a massage like a facial <SP1>
2994,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> and like a spa day <SP2>
2995,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> yeah and you can just like sit <SP2>
2996,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> in like hot tubs or something <SP2>
2997,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
2998,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> and just feel very spa <SP2>
2999,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> like a mud bath <SP1>
3000,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> and zen oo yeah <SP2>
3001,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> ugh <SP1>
3002,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> that would be nice <SP2>
3003,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
3004,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> this is so odd i don't know i guess it's not that odd <SP2>
3005,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> no it really it is like they try to make it creepy or something <SP1>
3006,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> yeah the fact that there's like c are there curtains on your side <SP2>
3007,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
3008,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> yea <SP2>
3009,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> like i wonder who built this building like do they have to specifically design weird compartments for weird psych studies <SP2>
3010,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> or do they have to like come in and do renovations <SP2>
3011,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> i guess so <SP1>
3012,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> hm <SP1>
3013,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> interesting i don't know <SP1>
3014,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> hm <SP1>
3015,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i think we get to leave after this <SP2>
3016,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> right <SP2>
3017,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah i think so <SP1>
3018,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> that's kinda nice <SP2>
3019,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> but also i feel like it's gonna take way longer <SP2>
3020,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> i know i feel <SP1>
3021,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> like i wonder when she's gonna come back i didn't really look at the time we got in here <SP2>
3022,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> i feel bad for like <SP1>
3023,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> like so are they just waiting to go right now <SP1>
3024,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> yeah but this would have also feel like been kind of weird thing to do with someone you didn't know <SP2>
3025,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
3026,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> but it when you would just ask the super basic questions <SP2>
3027,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah but then like what do you learn from that like what are they learn <SP1>
3028,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> right <SP2>
3029,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> she's like so surface level <SP1>
3030,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> they learn like what freshman year of college looks like <SP2>
3031,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
3032,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> and recruitment for sororities <SP2>
3033,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
3034,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> oh yeah i think i'm gonna drop my sorority but <SP2>
3035,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i don't know i think i am <SP2>

3037,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> just putting my feet up <SP1>
3038,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> oh <SP2>
3039,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i thought you see through <SP2>
3040,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> mm can you see you can see my feet <SP1>
3041,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> oh i guess so <SP2>
3042,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> um <SP1>
3043,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah i don't know <SP1>
3044,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> like are there th like am i not considering it like am i being impulsive almost like i i just really have trouble making decisions and i don't know like how to fix that necessarily <SP2>
3045,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> um <SP2>
3046,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> i don't think you're being impulsive cause like <SP1>
3047,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i've been thinking about it for a while <SP2>
3048,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> you've been thinking about it the whole time <SP1>
3049,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> but i don't really know like what i'm actually thinking <SP2>
3050,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i guess i'm thinking i think a lot of it unfortunately is also like <SP2>
3051,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> like outside influence like my family when i went to that wedding they were like <SP2>
3052,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> oh you joined a sorority like didn't we talk about not t like one of my cousins was didn't we talk about this cause we did we talked about what we were we did girls cousins weekends last year <SP2>

3055,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> we were in a hotel and there was like a sorority conference going on but it was crazy because they were like singing songs and i was like this is <SP2>
3056,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah it's totally different <SP1>
3057,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> yeah that's it yeah but i <SP2>
3058,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> and like my dad he's like fine but he was like like my mom was supportive like when i originally but then asked me when i was texting hannah morgan and my mom i was like who supports me dropping and they were all like me <SP2>
3059,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> but like i don't know <SP2>
3060,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> huh <SP2>
3061,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah i don't know <SP1>
3062,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i think really it's like one of the the biggest things is that i have tems <SP2>
3063,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> if <SP1>
3064,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
3065,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> and it like kind of is already that group it's just like easier and like i know i'm sure i'm sure the sorority would get better and but it's just that i'm already in a group that like fills that need as well as like being something else <SP2>
3066,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i don't know also i don't know whether she wrote for tems board especially after last night it seems so hard to plan a social <SP2>
3067,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
3068,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> like tell you planned it and then not a lot of people said they were gonna go but she sent out an email to all of us and she like put mike in charge and then <SP2>
3069,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> we kinda a did i tell you we have like one of our friends ended up sitting there for like a long time <SP2>
3070,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
3071,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> and so like i just felt so bad i was like wow this is a stressful job and its har <SP2>
3072,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> i think you could be good at it though <SP1>
3073,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> thanks <SP2>
3074,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah i do <SP1>
3075,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> it's just like an means i'm committing to like not study abroad in the fall <SP2>
3076,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> and i watched a movie about chile or chile <SP2>
3077,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i s <SP2>
3078,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> did you see there's like a tufts in chile in like <SP1>
3079,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> yeah did we miss the madrid one <SP2>
3080,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> pizza party <SP1>
3081,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
3082,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> oh <SP2>
3083,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> whoops <SP2>
3084,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> when's gonna be when is the the cadiz one <SP1>
3085,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> the cadiz <SP2>
3086,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
3087,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> come on <SP1>
3088,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> the thing is <SP2>
3089,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> the chile program i think would be really tough because well i don't think i would do the tufts one necessarily but it would be really like when katie was saying her sister who is like so fluent in french had such a hard time taking classes at french university there's no way <SP2>
3090,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> it's terrifying <SP1>
3091,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i could take classes in a spanish it's just that the problem is setting myself up for failure it's setting me up for so much stress when study abroad's supposed to be really fun a time when you don't take s like so many classes so that you have time to um travel <SP2>
3092,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
3093,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> so in like the cadiz program it feels very low stress and also you get a semester of spanish out of the way which is like helpful for me no matter what like it would not be a wasted credit <SP2>
3094,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
3095,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> because i need to take spanish <SP2>
3096,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> even for my six requirements like that would be my sixth so it'd just be fulfilling like a normal tufts distribution and then i wonder if like the culture one like is there are art thing we could take i don't know how that works <SP2>
3097,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> one eight <SP1>
3098,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> like would it count for an art credit potentially <SP2>
3099,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> no it's it would count <SP1>
3100,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> it's just a spanish culture <SP2>
3101,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> it would count for like a spanish culture if you're doing like the <SP1>
3102,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> oh <SP2>
3103,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> four and two type thing <SP1>
3104,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> okay <SP2>
3105,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> or something like that <SP1>
3106,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> so i guess that's kind of a waste but at the same time i would still be learning like hopefully so much spanish <SP2>
3107,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
3108,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> which is more like the end goal than like meeting any requirements <SP2>
3109,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
3110,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> very true <SP1>
3111,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> and it seems super fun li i mean look look at the people who went to talloires <SP2>
3112,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> that seemed really fun <SP2>
3113,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
3114,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> seemed like you get to travel a lot <SP2>
3115,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah like it'll be even better for us cause we're actually like taking classes in a language and like <SP1>
3116,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> right <SP2>
3117,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> learning it <SP1>
3118,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> right right is like <SP2>
3119,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> talloiresis english <SP1>
3120,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
3121,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> it would be so great we could be so fluent <SP2>
3122,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> i want you to come <SP1>
3123,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
3124,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> we should do that this summer and then you study abroad in the spring <SP1>
3125,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i think <SP2>
3126,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> okay that would make sense i would have to check i don't think that there's not south american programs in the spring i think it's just that the weather's not as great <SP2>
3127,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> mm kay <SP1>
3128,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> but also i can investigate cause they <SP2>
3129,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> my father made a good point like the closer to the equator you are it's just gonna be hotter <SP2>
3130,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> the warmer <SP1>
3131,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
3132,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> all year round <SP2>
3133,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> and anything is better than boston if we not anything but i think on the whole it will just be much more mild <SP2>
3134,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
3135,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> um but then i'd probably be going by myself potentially i don't really know a lot of people who are talking about south america in the spring <SP2>
3136,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
3137,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> but also <SP2>
3138,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> who was i talking to somebody in the sorority was like going to cuba next semester which i think is eally cool she <SP2>
3139,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
3140,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> oh hannah <SP2>
3141,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> oh <SP1>
3142,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> um she was also telling me about this club she has called cores <SP2>
3143,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> um <SP2>
3144,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> never heard of it <SP1>
3145,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> it's they go in and teach english classes to adults whose first language is spanish <SP2>
3146,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> i feel like i have heard of that actually <SP1>
3147,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> in the community <SP2>
3148,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> but it just seems such like such a cool club <SP2>
3149,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> it sounds familiar <SP1>
3150,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> like you know how i was kind of looking for i think i'm kind of back on the hunt for new cool club <SP2>
3151,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
3152,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> that i wanna do <SP2>
3153,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> sorority <SP1>
3154,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> yeah after that it was cause i was like oh i have two things now i'm back to like one <SP2>
3155,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> um kind of plus that other thing that i do sometimes and complain about <SP2>
3156,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
3157,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> but <SP2>
3158,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
3159,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
3160,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i think this is gonna be funny when we see the transcript we can could count how many words i say versus how many words you say <SP2>
3161,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> oh my god <SP1>
3162,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> yeah that will be interesting <SP1>
3163,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP2> i wonder if they'll like type in like nervous laughter like in astericks <SP2>
3164,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<SP1> probably <SP1>
3165,2018-10-27-session-1a_nogaps_step1_GPT,3,<END>

3199,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> it's just like very crisp <SP1>
3200,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
3201,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> why do they have to <SP1>
3202,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> it's like sleek white <SP2>
3203,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> make this so perfect <SP1>
3204,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> yeah why <SP2>
3205,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> it's so creepy <SP2>
3206,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> it's so creepy <SP1>
3207,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> and just like well i guess the cameras aren't in the same way but <SP1>
3208,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> it really doesn't look like two rooms <SP2>
3209,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> no <SP1>
3210,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> i guess that's the point <SP1>
3211,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> m <SP2>
3212,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
3213,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> so it's like we're like at a table <SP1>
3214,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> oh <SP2>
3215,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> talking to each other <SP1>
3216,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> but i wonder what the point of shooting us through like glasses like what's the point of the glass <SP2>
3217,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> i don't know yeah like why not just have us be in one room <SP1>
3218,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> maybe for like microphone quality <SP2>
3219,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> maybe yeah cause i couldn't like hear each other through the <SP1>
3220,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> like without the microphone <SP1>

3485,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> yeah but i feel like that's very like that's something that could like definitely happen <SP1>
3486,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> yeah that was like one of the more realistic <SP2>
3487,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> it was it's <SP2>
3488,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> yeah <SP1>

3505,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> it's kinda gruesome <SP2>
3506,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> extreme <SP1>
3507,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
3508,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> should we just take the l and watch metalhead <SP2>
3509,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> i feel like <SP2>
3510,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> the only one like no one's seen <SP2>
3511,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> i've seen it <SP1>
3512,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> you've seen it <SP2>
3513,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> think so <SP1>
3514,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> what's it about <SP1>
3515,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> i don't know it's in black and white <SP2>
3516,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> yeah i've seen it <SP1>
3517,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> was it good <SP2>
3518,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> it's like okay it was kind of weird there's one character <SP1>
3519,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> can i tell you what happened <SP1>
3520,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> no <SP1>
3521,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
3522,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
3523,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> is it isn't it just her escaping from something <SP2>
3524,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
3525,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> and then at the end you find out that it was all over like a teddy bear <SP1>
3526,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> and you're like what <SP1>
3527,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> it was like on a teddy bear <SP2>
3528,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> no it was all over a teddy bear <SP1>
3529,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> like the reason that she was like trying to escape from something the reason that she was in danger was cause they were trying to get a teddy bear for someone it was just it's like kind of weird <SP1>
3530,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> i thought you're gonna say it was like exists like on a molecule <SP2>
3531,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> on a teddy bear <SP2>
3532,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> not mm nope <SP1>
3533,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> and i was that would have been crazy <SP2>
3534,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> like you watch like a whole story <SP2>
3535,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> why would that have happened <SP1>
3536,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> and then you find out that it's just a molecule <SP2>
3537,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP1> oh <SP1>
3538,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> like <SP2>

3946,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<SP2> dangerous <SP2>
3947,2018-02-03-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,4,<END>
3948,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<START>
3949,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> okay s so <SP2>
3950,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> this is weird <SP1>
3951,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yep <SP2>
3952,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> it's like a two way mirror but only a one way mirror or <SP1>
3953,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
3954,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> or all way mirror i don't know not really mirror <SP1>
3955,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> or is mirror the reality <SP2>
3956,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> question mark <SP2>
3957,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> isn't it by definition a reflection of reality <SP1>
3958,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> whatever you whatever you think man <SP2>
3959,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> if you could see through it would it would just be a no way mirror right a zero way mirror <SP1>
3960,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> i guess yeah <SP2>
3961,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> or a one <SP2>
3962,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> are one way mirrors the one that you can see through <SP1>
3963,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> a from one side but not the other side <SP1>
3964,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> this is an existential conversation we're having <SP2>
3965,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah i feel like it probably would cause a twoway mirror would be reflective on both sides and you wouldn't be able to see much through it <SP1>
3966,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> astute <SP2>
3967,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> astute sir <SP2>
3968,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> this room is weird i feel like i'm in a padded room <SP1>
3969,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> i feel like you're in front of a green screen and i should be seeing like some kind of like <SP2>
3970,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> like some nice visuals in the back <SP1>
3971,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> interesting background <SP2>
3972,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah there personal question for you if you could be in front of any green screen background what would it be <SP2>
3973,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i quite like the green in the background green's my favorite color i think i' m just happy with this <SP1>
3974,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> man of simplicity <SP2>
3975,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> what would you <SP1>
3976,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> wow <SP2>
3977,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> would you prefer to be in front of fake backgrounds <SP1>
3978,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> well see <SP2>
3979,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> neon green disturbs me <SP2>
3980,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> we can't be friends then <SP1>
3981,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> fine that's fine i don't <SP2>
3982,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> neon green is like the third best green <SP1>
3983,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> no <SP2>
3984,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah absolutely <SP1>
3985,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> muted colors are always the most elegant <SP2>
3986,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> what are you talking about <SP2>
3987,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> muted colors like what what's a muted what would you even consider a muted color <SP1>
3988,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> like <SP2>
3989,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> like forest green is an acceptable green because it's not like in your face you know it's like a polite green that asks you how are you and doesn't like punch you in the face like neon green does <SP2>
3990,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> on one hand i agree because forest green is obviously the best green <SP1>
3991,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> of course you agree because i'm always right <SP2>
3992,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i i would say it's more that forest green is just the best green <SP1>
3993,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> neon green sucks <SP2>
3994,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> that being said that being said <SP1>
3995,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> neon green is one of the best greens <SP1>
3996,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> but it's not the best <SP1>
3997,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> no you're wrong <SP2>
3998,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> but it's it's close <SP1>
3999,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> you're wrong <SP2>
4000,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> the tree wait do you have a tree too <SP1>
4001,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yes i think so if you count tha yeah that's a tree <SP2>
4002,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah we have like mirror rooms kinda weird there's even a weird yellow paper in the bottom corner on both <SP1>
4003,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> interesting <SP1>
4004,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> oh i think they meant for it to be like this to seem like um okay <SP2>
4005,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> it's like a mirror except for it's you and not me in the mirror <SP1>
4006,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yup <SP2>
4007,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> that's weird <SP1>
4008,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> it's kinda like you're talking to yourself but you're hallucinating it's me <SP2>
4009,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> ah i wouldn't yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't classify it that way but yeah <SP1>
4010,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
4011,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i like the the green uh on the leaves though is like the best green <SP1>
4012,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> very observant what kind of shade is that what would you call that <SP2>
4013,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> leaf green <SP1>
4014,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> very descriptive as well <SP1>
4015,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> you should you should be an artist like you're just the creativity is just like oozing today <SP2>
4016,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
4017,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> you know when you're stuck in a in a large pad box it's hard to be creative <SP1>
4018,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> i yeah i can understand the pain <SP2>
4019,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> this is crazy are you going to winter ball tonight <SP1>
4020,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> i don't know i was thinking about it why <SP2>
4021,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i am also thinking about it but i probably <SP1>
4022,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i don't think i'm gonna go <SP1>
4023,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah i mean <SP2>
4024,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> because it's ten dollars and that's a lot of dollars but on the other hand like <SP1>
4025,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> typical student huh <SP2>
4026,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah but like on the other hand like it's an experience and like you shouldn't miss out on experiences if you have the choice i feel like <SP1>
4027,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> that's true <SP2>
4028,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> but then some experiences are better than others and i don't know a the quality of this experience because i've heard that it's less of a dance and more of a concert and that doesn't sound very <SP2>
4029,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> enticing <SP2>
4030,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> appealing <SP1>
4031,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah i feel that <SP1>
4032,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> dancing is fun though <SP2>
4033,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i can't say i feel that <SP1>

4044,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> there we go you know what's a better experience dancing <SP2>
4045,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah but dancing will be included in that experience so i feel like <SP1>
4046,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> no concert dancing is different that's like swaying and being boring that's not <SP2>
4047,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
4048,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> that's not dancing <SP1>
4049,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> it doesn't count <SP2>
4050,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i can't dance then <SP1>

4101,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> as always <SP2>
4102,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> i'm on a roll today <SP2>
4103,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> as always <SP1>
4104,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> my dad always used to say <SP1>
4105,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i i i'm always right except for the one time i thought i was wrong but i was actually right <SP1>

4242,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> i can't even i'm having too many feelings <SP2>
4243,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i don't even know how to <SP1>
4244,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> if you go to take a break and um crash <SP1>
4245,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
4246,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i would feel but no i wouldn't feel but i mean it's all it that well that i t wasn't even meant that way at all <SP1>
4247,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> you wouldn't even feel ba <SP2>
4248,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> do you feel while <SP2>
4249,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> well i mean if you're crying out i have like a <SP1>
4250,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> good an ice cold heart <SP2>
4251,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> could just <SP2>
4252,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> there's like a baseline of like sadness like empathy maybe but <SP1>
4253,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> well <SP2>
4254,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i don't think it's <SP1>
4255,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> deserves so <SP1>
4256,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> empathy is very important and it's a defining factor in emotional intelligence did you know that <SP2>
4257,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i didn't know that but last night we were watching planet earth two and they were talking about animal intuition and i was just like like i was just my mind was blown by the fact that there's like intuition like you don't even i don't know it doesn't make sense to me i don't know <SP1>
4258,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> like i can't comprehend intuition <SP1>
4259,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> what do you mean <SP2>
4260,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> like <SP2>
4261,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> in general <SP2>
4262,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
4263,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> cause like <SP1>
4264,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> it's like a sixth sense it's just a feeling you get <SP2>
4265,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah but where does that come from <SP1>
4266,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> lives you know <SP2>
4267,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> how how does like a <SP1>
4268,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> i think we i feel like we develop it because we learn a lot about social interactions and we kind of pick um <SP2>
4269,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah but how do like baby turtles know to go towards the light <SP1>
4270,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> well they're biologically programmed i would think there's certain cells in t he brain <SP2>
4271,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> but what is the biological programming like this is where i'm confused <SP1>
4272,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> well we we're kind of talking about that in psych nine a little bit like the brain like brain plasticity and how like the brain adapts to certain situations i guess <SP2>
4273,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> where i'm lost <SP1>
4274,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> throughout the evolution <SP2>
4275,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> but <SP1>
4276,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> but it's saying that it can become like pre that they can come for it out did <SP1>
4277,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
4278,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> that's crazy <SP1>
4279,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> a lot of animal do that we're some of the only <SP2>
4280,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> so should not be like evidence for like physical <SP1>
4281,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> like <SP2>
4282,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> like there's a physical <SP1>
4283,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> part of like memory <SP1>
4284,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah yeah the brain is constantly like reconfiguring itself throughout the evolution of the species like i feel like we're the only ones that have to develop like after were born like a lot of animals just come pre programm ed already but some <SP2>
4285,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah but i feel like i like all animals word <SP1>
4286,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> thanks <SP2>
4287,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i don't think learning is outside of the room <SP1>
4288,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> no no they demonstrate learning but i feel like we are the only ones t hat are were born the most help i mean if you think about it like a baby zebra or something will start walking within like a day to and we're like just vegetated dental work <SP2>
4289,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
4290,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> two and a half so <SP2>
4291,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i guess i guess animals that are like <SP1>
4292,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> protected by their mothers are much more hopeless <SP1>
4293,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> general i i guess i w ould agree with that <SP1>
4294,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah that's true where were very spoiled species <SP2>
4295,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> cause like animals like i i was just thinking like if you're born alone you have to come out of your egg alone and you just know <SP1>
4296,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> like that you need to go towards the water <SP1>
4297,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> not in the full moon and stuff like that like <SP1>
4298,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah that's true <SP2>
4299,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> although some animals were demonstrated to sh demonstrate um they show altruism so like if their kid is in some kind of danger they will sacrifice themselves so animals do that <SP2>
4300,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah i feel like altruism is like a pretty explainable <SP1>
4301,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> thing <SP1>
4302,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
4303,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> like i'm like <SP1>
4304,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> like and imprinting and stuff like that <SP2>
4305,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah definitely i don't like i must not fully understand the like <SP1>
4306,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> the controversy around um <SP1>
4307,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> whatever we were just talking about which i have forgotten <SP1>
4308,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> intuition altruism <SP2>
4309,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> imprinting <SP2>
4310,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> altruism <SP1>
4311,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> altruism yeah yeah yeah <SP1>
4312,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> okay <SP2>
4313,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i feel like i don't understand the controversy around altruism i feel like it's pretty explainable like like fitness trait <SP1>
4314,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> i guess yeah i mean i don't know it's kind of like if you are on the team of survival of the fittest then it's kinda strange that a fit mother would for example sacrifice herself to protect her sickly child like that seems kind of counter intuitive but then <SP2>
4315,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i think sickly it might be a defining characteristic which would make altruism not really as important <SP1>
4316,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i i think i feel like altruism makes sense a lot if you view the goal as passing on your genes <SP1>
4317,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> why what do you mean <SP2>
4318,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> if your kids are like <SP1>
4319,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> meaning if the kids are healthy <SP2>
4320,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> and they're being in <SP2>
4321,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> if you're yeah so it's in your best interest to keep your it's much easier to keep a kid healthy than it is to literally become pregnant and then like have the kid again <SP1>
4322,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> okay <SP2>
4323,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> gotcha <SP2>
4324,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> okay <SP2>
4325,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> so it's like within your it's in your best interest to keep them alive <SP1>
4326,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> i'll give it to you <SP2>
4327,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i feel like i <SP1>
4328,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> that's true that makes sense <SP2>
4329,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i don't know maybe it's too like utilitarian <SP1>
4330,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> where to look at it i don't know <SP1>
4331,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> at the end the world is brutal i mean there's no democracy over there it's just like you sick bye <SP2>
4332,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> right <SP1>
4333,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> see ya <SP2>
4334,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah like that's <SP1>
4335,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> so no health care <SP2>
4336,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> for the animals <SP2>
4337,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> it <SP1>
4338,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> it's so human to like project and anthropomorphize stuff <SP1>
4339,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah for sure <SP2>
4340,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> and just like <SP1>
4341,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> give it like you know personify things but <SP1>
4342,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
4343,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> in reality like things don't care there's no mercy there's no empathy like <SP1>
4344,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> nope <SP2>
4345,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> not at all i mean i we were learning a lot about that in psych twenty eight last semester about um self reference and self generation and things like you're more l kely to remember things and you're more likely to understand things if you do them yourself and you relate them to yourself somehow <SP2>
4346,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
4347,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> so human beings have this tendency to <SP2>
4348,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> relate things <SP1>
4349,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> focus on themselves a lot <SP2>
4350,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
4351,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
4352,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> sure <SP2>
4353,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> that stuff was crazy <SP1>
4354,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
4355,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i love psychology so much <SP1>
4356,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> me too <SP2>
4357,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i'm so excited <SP1>
4358,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> i feel you i'm still finishing that book games people play and i'm in s i'm in love you have to read it like it's so good so good <SP2>
4359,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> sounds like a lot of reading <SP1>
4360,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> it's short <SP2>
4361,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> come on it's short it's literally <SP2>
4362,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> sounds like a lot of reading <SP1>
4363,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> it's i'm not the kind of person who <SP2>
4364,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> is it more than like sixty pages <SP1>
4365,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> i don't even think so and i wouldn't recommend you something that isn't worth reading okay i don't read trash <SP2>
4366,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> how do you know if it's trash until you've read it <SP1>
4367,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> because i told you my opinion is of infinite value okay <SP2>
4368,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> can trust me <SP2>
4369,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i'm sure you've read trash before <SP1>
4370,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> no i <SP2>
4371,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i can't trust you <SP1>

4578,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> hate her but <SP1>
4579,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> and i'm like well you should be appreciative <SP2>
4580,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> no like you have to understand like they just want the best for like him <SP1>
4581,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
4582,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> but like what she thinks is best of him is just <SP1>
4583,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> not best for him because he is really bad at it <SP1>
4584,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> not best for him <SP2>
4585,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah he's really bad at it so <SP1>

4693,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> at all <SP2>
4694,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> i mean <SP2>
4695,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i wouldn't declare a comp sci minor <SP1>
4696,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> or anything like that until you've done comp <SP1>
4697,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> although i i d i do know some comes i jokes like hey you're boolean me so mean <SP2>
4698,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> boolean <SP1>
4699,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> false <SP1>
4700,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> equals equals <SP2>
4701,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> or true <SP1>
4702,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> equals equals true because you're mean to me <SP2>
4703,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> equals equals <SP1>
4704,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah there's like i remember what the equals equals is there's equals equals equals and then like <SP1>
4705,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> not equal to which is exclamation point and equal it's just it's just a lot like i don't know it's all syntax <SP1>
4706,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> y you're just scaring me now <SP2>
4707,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i really don't like language <SP1>
4708,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i love language i love languages <SP1>
4709,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> but i hate la learning it <SP1>
4710,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> like actual language but not <SP2>
4711,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> like i does don't at all want to be involved in learning them <SP1>
4712,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> that too <SP2>
4713,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i just think they're cool and like <SP1>
4714,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> what language are you taking for your credits <SP2>
4715,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i took latin three semesters <SP1>
4716,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> oh that's really cool <SP2>
4717,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> it was like sick yeah it was it was like a fifteen person class <SP1>
4718,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> do you like it <SP2>
4719,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> with like a super like the best professor <SP1>
4720,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> can you like create a new harry potter spell or something <SP2>
4721,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> no but like it's actually pretty sick like being able to read <SP1>
4722,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> that's really cool <SP2>
4723,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> um <SP1>
4724,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> like i'm i did alm i did very little of the translation homework but like some kids i know like are actually fluent in latin it's crazy <SP1>
4725,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> supposed to do your homework sir it's not very studious <SP2>
4726,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> it wasn't graded <SP1>
4727,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> so no incentive <SP1>
4728,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah i still have to take my french culture class and then i'll be done i got almost all my credits from high school <SP2>
4729,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> lucky <SP1>
4730,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> but i really should've taken that russian placement exam that would probably make things easier for me <SP2>
4731,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> if you would well you can in order to place out of a language you can do two languages to twelve like a three class level <SP1>
4732,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
4733,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> or you could do one language to like anywhere from three to six and then like culture classes and stuff <SP1>
4734,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> gotcha <SP2>
4735,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> but if you'd place into like russian four and french four you would've been completely done with your requirement <SP1>
4736,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah i mean the thing is like i am aware of the fact that most of my russian is very casual and conversational and i can read and all that but actual like writing compositions that are formal and whatever i i don't have the skills for that so i feel like i would probably struggle in high level russian class <SP2>
4737,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
4738,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> cause you have to do everything i can just <SP2>
4739,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> you know make jokes and whatever and i can interact <SP2>
4740,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> you could take like russian three though and then just do one year of rush one semester of russian and be done but whatever <SP1>
4741,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> it's too late <SP1>
4742,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah i mean it's fine i i pla practice enogh russian with my family and all that so <SP2>
4743,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
4744,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> i'll just learn about french culture <SP2>
4745,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i have a friend <SP1>
4746,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> one of the kids in my suite is from honduras and like it's funny because even though honduras obviously is a spanish speaking country like primarily he um grew up in like pr he went to like private schools that taught english <SP1>
4747,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> hm <SP2>
4748,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> um so english is like like really his best language his first language um and spanish he's very conversational but he's like it's funny cause we have like four five kids who take spanish in the suite and they all like call him out so often on like grammar <SP1>
4749,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> hm <SP2>
4750,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> and like spelling mistakes and stuff <SP1>
4751,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> so funny <SP2>
4752,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> thing is about learning a language um like as a just in your family or whatever it's really interesting because conversationally you are much more likely to have an interesting conversation with someone than people who learn it formally like i had that experience with french like when i talk to people who knew french slang and things like that like it's almost a separate thing in of itself to know all the slang and i feel like it's just it's not as interesting like versus writing at somebody who only has an oral education writing is impossible <SP2>
4753,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> but then people who are formally educated can write an essay and all <SP2>
4754,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
4755,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> so i don't know <SP2>
4756,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> what else whatever's more useful you know <SP2>
4757,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah but like <SP1>
4758,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i f i feel like it's more of a function of like if you learn it conversationally you learn vocab and then you learn grammar <SP1>
4759,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> i yeah <SP2>
4760,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah like you learn those at the same time and <SP1>
4761,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> grammar becomes kind of intuitive almost <SP2>
4762,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
4763,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> because it's like trial and error <SP2>
4764,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> you can just pick up on it yeah <SP1>
4765,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah yeah yeah <SP2>
4766,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> but when you learn it formally there's no like actual practicing the way that like <SP1>
4767,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> mm <SP2>
4768,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> at least in my experience there was no actual practice in the way that like immersion is practice <SP1>
4769,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
4770,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> and as such like vocab kinda just is fleeting like you learn it for a month to get pass the test but then you move on <SP1>
4771,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> it's yeah it's so much easier to learn it kind of on the way i think languages are more like gradual that way i feel like learning them formally it's almost counterproductive <SP2>
4772,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> it sucks i hate languages <SP1>
4773,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
4774,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i hate languages the only time i would ever like i would be down to learn another language but i would only do it for immersion <SP1>
4775,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> russian <SP2>
4776,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i wouldn't do it <SP1>
4777,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> russian learn russian <SP2>
4778,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> i'm not learning russian <SP1>
4779,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> i'll help <SP2>
4780,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP1> russian doesn't have the same alphabet does it <SP1>
4781,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> come on <SP2>
4782,2018-02-10-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,5,<SP2> no it's really different <SP2>

4830,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> the regular psych building <SP2>
4831,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>
4832,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i think at eleven or eleven fifteen <SP2>
4833,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> oh wow nice <SP1>
4834,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah i double booked myself so are you a junior or senior <SP2>

4840,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> cool what are you gonna do next <SP1>
4841,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> uh actually i'm going into consulting next year <SP2>
4842,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> oh nice so you already know <SP1>
4843,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
4844,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> cool this tea is like a little too hot <SP1>
4845,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i'm pretty sure the milk was actually bad <SP2>
4846,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> so i don't wanna say anything though <SP2>
4847,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> really <SP1>
4848,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> oh that's so gross <SP1>
4849,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> but it like flaked off and i smelled it and it was gross so was just like <SP2>
4850,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> did you put it in your <SP1>
4851,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> no <SP2>
4852,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i wonder if that's part of the experiment <SP1>
4853,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i was thinking that the whole time like what is part of the experiment <SP2>
4854,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah there was one time that i was tricked for one of these for intro to psych <SP1>
4855,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> oh really <SP2>
4856,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah um like the other participant was actually a plant <SP1>
4857,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> so like when i first came in and saw you i thought that you were a plant <SP1>
4858,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah that was pretty rough but anyway so you're gonna do consulting where is that gonna be <SP1>
4859,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> luckily in boston <SP2>
4860,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> nice <SP1>
4861,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
4862,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i i'm so uh i'm not sure if you know anything about consulting but <SP2>
4863,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> like a little <SP1>
4864,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah i i unfortunately do <SP2>
4865,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>
4866,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> but um i'm choosing between a firm called oliver weinmann and another one called deloitte so i <SP2>
4867,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> oh yeah i know deloitte <SP1>
4868,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah i just have to make make a decision at some point in the next week <SP2>
4869,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i've heard of that <SP1>
4870,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
4871,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> geez <SP1>
4872,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> although i assume <SP2>
4873,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> congrats <SP1>
4874,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah it's funny cause i'm an english major <SP2>
4875,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> right <SP1>
4876,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and i could not be dumber at eighty percent of the stuff that you need for consulting <SP2>
4877,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> but cause it don't they like ask you stuff during the interview like how many marbles will fit in an airplane <SP1>
4878,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> oh yeah <SP2>
4879,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> it's a ton of math and i can't i'm in psych stats for my math requirement <SP2>
4880,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
4881,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> so like clearly not <SP1>
4882,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
4883,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> like a math person <SP1>
4884,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> it's so bad i had some guy ask me i was doing it's you do these things called mark uh market sizing where they'll ask you how many cabs are let's say in new york city <SP2>
4885,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>
4886,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>
4887,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and you just have to figure it out from mentally <SP2>
4888,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
4889,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> thinking about all these factors and i had to do something like seven times forty two hundred and i looked at the guy and i was like look there's not an answer i don't know i'm gonna be honest and he was like okay <SP2>
4890,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's so stressful but you got it that's kind of cool <SP1>
4891,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah seven yeah that that was a different one but somehow that went okay <SP2>
4892,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> wow <SP1>
4893,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> nice <SP1>
4894,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah you meet the ust you meet the oddest people <SP2>
4895,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> uh huh <SP1>
4896,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> for like for that one i completely fucked up every part of it but the whole day they were saying you know we have this guy named hank he's brilliant he's your last interview they're like our clients can't get enough of hank and then this guy waddles in in the end <SP2>
4897,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
4898,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and he's like clearly neurotic he's got like overlapping bottom teeth and he has my resume and he keeps flipping it over and over even know there's nothing on the back <SP2>
4899,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
4900,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> oh my god i can't i like know exactly the kind of person you're talking <SP1>
4901,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and i'm thinking like holy shit <SP2>
4902,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
4903,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> about <SP1>
4904,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and then he's like alright i'm gonna give you a graph and i want you to solve it so he writes this graph with like eleven different lines going <SP2>
4905,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
4906,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and he's like all right solve this and i'm like i don't know what the fuck i'm looking at <SP2>
4907,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> so i start making shit up and he's like that's all wrong and then he takes it back and he's like i drew it wrong he crosses everything out gives me like another eleven lines and i'm like dude i can't read it and he's like of course <SP2>
4908,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and he takes it back does anoth nother one a new one and gives it to me and i was like i and he's like you know what i drew it wrong again and i was like okay <SP2>
4909,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> did he ever draw it right <SP1>
4910,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> no he was like let's just do let's just talk <SP2>
4911,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i wonder if that was part of the test <SP1>
4912,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i think he's just c uh my idea is that he goes into a conference room everyday <SP2>
4913,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
4914,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and gets like everything wrong and everyone at the company is like he's brilliant he's done it again <SP2>
4915,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's so crazy wow <SP1>
4916,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> he's my idol it was like it was a firm called novantis and it's extremely analytical <SP2>
4917,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>
4918,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> modeling for finance <SP2>
4919,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>
4920,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> which is pretty much like the absolute opposite of what i'd be good at <SP2>
4921,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>
4922,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> but he's a philosophy major <SP2>
4923,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> oh cool <SP1>
4924,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and he's like a huge partner at it and i was like you're my hero <SP2>
4925,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's awesome <SP1>
4926,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
4927,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i'm a big proponent of people just like majoring in whatever they like and then just doing something else random with it <SP1>
4928,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
4929,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> um that's kind of what i'm doing with anthropology i think like just i'm not gonna do anything with anthropology probably in my future but i like it <SP1>
4930,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> oh really <SP2>
4931,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> what was the other one biology <SP2>
4932,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> so <SP1>
4933,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> biology <SP1>
4934,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> that's a pretty good one to have <SP2>
4935,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah yeah uh <SP1>
4936,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i have a lot of respect for that because of the amount that i would be bad at it <SP2>
4937,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> would be astronomical <SP2>
4938,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i bet you could do it i mean it's honestly just like memorizing patterns and then applying those patterns to other things and like once you understand like how something <SP1>
4939,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> that does make it sound pretty good <SP2>
4940,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah so like once you learn how to play the biology game <SP1>
4941,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
4942,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> like you're good it's like orgo like <SP1>
4943,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> for english once you know how to read you're set <SP2>
4944,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> see that's what i'm struggling with right now oh my god i <SP1>
4945,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> you're really good <SP2>
4946,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> oh my god i am questioning my like general reading comprehension comprehension i have to like present on these two like uh one ten page reading and one twenty page reading for my class on wednesday i spent literally all of saturday trying to read these thirty pages and i just like and they were so simple they were like ethnographic just like a story and i was just like so i don't know i i think like i'm a senior in college but i still like can't comprehend readings <SP1>
4947,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> do you ever have to write essays for any of your classes <SP2>
4948,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> anthropology all the time <SP1>
4949,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> oh okay <SP2>
4950,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> so <SP1>
4951,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> there you go <SP2>
4952,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i mean i used to be able to do it i think somewhere like within the past six months i just like forgot how to do <SP1>
4953,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
4954,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> reading and writing <SP1>
4955,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> that's my fear is that i'll graduate i'm gonna go into uh consulting which i find really interesting <SP2>
4956,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
4957,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> uh huh <SP1>
4958,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> but i don't know if i'm gonna have to be writing in the same way that i write now <SP2>
4959,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> uh huh <SP1>
4960,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and mainly i have to also say that cause if this is out there i really need to talk about the fact that i do like consulting <SP2>
4961,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah yeah yeah <SP1>
4962,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
4963,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> can you actually explain like why consulting firms hire students directly out of college like who presumably don't have the experience of the people that they're consulting for like that's something that's <SP1>
4964,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
4965,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i think is an interesting phenomenon <SP1>
4966,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> probably just because uh we're cheaper <SP2>
4967,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>
4968,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> than an actual experienced hire <SP2>
4969,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that makes sense <SP1>
4970,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah also i think to b like consulting itself means absolutely nothing <SP2>
4971,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's what i've always thought <SP1>
4972,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah it means the word itself means definitely nothing because it could mean anything <SP2>
4973,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>
4974,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i mean if i was telling my dad which shoe to put on i'd be consulting him <SP2>
4975,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> right fair <SP1>
4976,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> but um a lot of people say the job of the consultant is to take someone's watch off their arm and tell them what time it is <SP2>
4977,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>
4978,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i i mean i don't know if that's true or not cause i i did it last summer but i don't really know what it's like <SP2>
4979,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> cool <SP1>
4980,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> to do for couple years <SP2>
4981,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> uh huh <SP1>
4982,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i just think you get to learn so much about so many different industries <SP2>
4983,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
4984,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and your only job is to learn and the idea is that a third party who is supposed to be smart from a good college <SP2>
4985,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's cool <SP1>
4986,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
4987,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> will be able to have some insight into what someone else is doing <SP2>
4988,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
4989,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> maybe they're too engrossed to be able to see <SP2>
4990,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> oh okay <SP1>
4991,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> so you get to have a lot of experience in a lot of t different industries <SP2>
4992,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's cool <SP1>
4993,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> so yeah for that stuff i think it's gonna be really fun <SP2>
4994,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah that is gonna be fun <SP1>
4995,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> but <SP2>
4996,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i've also heard my hours are from seven am to twelve am so <SP2>
4997,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> nice <SP1>
4998,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> might be tough for me <SP2>
4999,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah okay well you just won't have a social life but weekends <SP1>
5000,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> uh yeah no i think so i usually you're supposed to travel monday through thursday but i am gonna be living with my twelve best friends from college probably <SP2>
5001,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>

5005,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> in boston <SP2>
5006,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's gonna be amazing and probably the only way you can afford to live in boston <SP1>
5007,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> so <SP2>
5008,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah we're probably going to have to live in like sommerville <SP2>
5009,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5010,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5011,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's awesome wow that's really cool that you're all ending up in boston because like right now <SP1>
5012,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>

5014,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah it's also scares like all your friends like when are you gonna see them again if you don't live with them <SP2>
5015,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i know <SP1>

5017,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5018,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> it what's so weird is that like next we have to make adult friends <SP1>

5023,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> oh that's rough yeah <SP2>
5024,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> so <SP1>
5025,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> it was like who am i friends with or like how do i form relationships that aren't just professional <SP1>
5026,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>

5028,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's kind of weird <SP1>
5029,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah luckily u uh everyone at most people i worked with were our age <SP2>
5030,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's nice <SP1>
5031,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah and one kid was just he's brilliant at math but he was a meth addict and went to a buddhist monastery to get clean he goes to mit <SP2>
5032,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> what that's so crazy <SP1>

5049,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> wow it's so interesting to think how like drugs make people more or less productive or more brilliant <SP1>
5050,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> some people get really productive from it <SP2>
5051,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5052,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> which is odd to me <SP2>
5053,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah at i was in a class last year i guess that we talked about um bio hacking i think is what it's called in silicon valley <SP1>
5054,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5055,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> where like people are just taking so many drugs to like be more productive <SP1>
5056,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah i know what you're talking about yeah <SP2>
5057,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5058,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> that would never work for me <SP2>
5059,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5060,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> no i feel like i mean if i smoked i'd be done i'd be like all right <SP2>
5061,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5062,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i'm out <SP2>
5063,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's true that's true i think i have too much anxiety about like my general health and then like <SP1>
5064,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> oh yeah that's another thing i like <SP2>
5065,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> what my mental state would be like <SP1>
5066,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i yeah i just don't want to f like fuck my body up <SP2>
5067,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> right yeah <SP1>
5068,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5069,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5070,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i'm pre med and like <SP1>
5071,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> oh yeah <SP2>
5072,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> working in a hospital right now <SP1>
5073,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> oh that's cool <SP2>
5074,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah it is really cool but i was never a hypochondriac before and now i'm like i have diabetes and i have <SP1>
5075,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> that would freak me the fuck out yeah <SP2>
5076,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> like all these infections and like yeah <SP1>
5077,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> even spending a lot of time in a hospital i'd be like i must've contracted something today <SP2>
5078,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i definitely got pink eye one time from work <SP1>
5079,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> really <SP2>
5080,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5081,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> it was really sad <SP1>
5082,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> that's horrible <SP2>
5083,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> because i think i like do a lot of hand sanitation you know like i'm always <SP1>
5084,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5085,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> washing my hands but still still happened <SP1>
5086,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah that i couldn't do that <SP2>
5087,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5088,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5089,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> it's fun though <SP1>
5090,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> that is really cool to me and this is an odd opinion i mean i think my profession will be extremely fun <SP2>
5091,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5092,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and i'll get to learn a lot but i view almost being a doctor as the only meaningful <SP2>
5093,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5094,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> oh <SP1>
5095,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> profession <SP2>
5096,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> that i can think of other than being a teacher which is what i want to do in my like fifties <SP2>
5097,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5098,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> oh that's a really cool path <SP1>
5099,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i def yeah i definitely want to be an english teacher by the time i'm fifty i wanna like pay for my kids colleges by the time i'm forty five <SP2>
5100,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5101,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5102,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and then immediately become an english teacher <SP2>
5103,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> smart very smart yeah cause you can't do that starting with english teaching probably or it <SP1>
5104,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5105,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i cannot <SP2>
5106,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> it will be a lot harder i guess <SP1>
5107,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah the jump from english teacher to consulting will be much more difficult <SP2>
5108,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah yeah <SP1>
5109,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5110,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> neat <SP1>
5111,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> but <SP2>
5112,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> sounds like you've got a good <SP1>
5113,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> plan though <SP1>
5114,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah i realize my plan will definitely fall through <SP2>
5115,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> why <SP1>
5116,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> uh i feel i mean my dad wanted i think he wanted to be a history teacher when he was my age and we are the exact same person in every way <SP2>
5117,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5118,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5119,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> but now he's been a lawyer for like thirty years and he started out doing it for <SP2>
5120,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> oh <SP1>
5121,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> people who were uh what's it like labor law <SP2>
5122,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>
5123,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> but now he does intellectual property law for merck and pfizer <SP2>
5124,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> what does that mean <SP1>
5125,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> uh pretty much let's say you're merck do you know you know uh <SP2>
5126,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> merck yeah the the drug company <SP1>
5127,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5128,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> so let's say that they have a new drug they need to patent it so that no one else can pretty much use the same drug and that they can collect all the market from it <SP2>
5129,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mm <SP1>
5130,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5131,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5132,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> my dad makes sure that when that patent is challenged by another company let's say merck thinks that oh pfizer came out with something but it's too similar to ours <SP2>
5133,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5134,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5135,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and they don't want it to be sold to anyone else my dad will go in and be like errerererer <SP2>
5136,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and pretty much make sure that merck uh keeps their patent and that pfizer can't sell whatever they sold <SP2>
5137,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> wow <SP1>
5138,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah which there are <SP2>
5139,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's interesting <SP1>
5140,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> societal benefits but mainly societal downsides too <SP2>
5141,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah i guess so i mean <SP1>
5142,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> drug companies are interesting and like a tough thing for me to wrap my head around because like <SP1>
5143,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5144,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> their bottom line like yes they're bettering the world with medicine but <SP1>
5145,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah so much of its insane profit driven <SP2>
5146,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> they're also so much about profit yeah <SP1>
5147,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5148,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> which is everything honestly like even being a doctor like <SP1>
5149,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5150,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> you go into work <SP1>
5151,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> that's true <SP2>
5152,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> probably <SP1>
5153,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> at least partially because you're getting paid for it and like <SP1>
5154,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5155,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> is a high it's a good paying job <SP2>
5156,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5157,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> but to me it's like a job where it's like good paying but you're doing actually so much good <SP2>
5158,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5159,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> every day <SP2>
5160,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> hopefully hopefully <SP1>
5161,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5162,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5163,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's the goal <SP1>
5164,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i mean my dad l my dad's like <SP2>
5165,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> amazingly weirdly smart <SP2>
5166,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> uh huh <SP1>
5167,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> he's like a history major <SP2>
5168,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5169,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and is doing things with science somehow <SP2>
5170,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah that's amazing <SP1>
5171,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> that make no sense to me so <SP2>
5172,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's really cool wow <SP1>
5173,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> he probably gets he gets a kick out of that part of it <SP2>
5174,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah i'm sure <SP1>
5175,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5176,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i mean i guess it's something good to look forward to that even though like we're academic our academic career kind of is ending soon like we're still gonna to be learning and changing and <SP1>
5177,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> which is weird yeah <SP2>
5178,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah i just wanna yeah i don't really want that to stop <SP2>
5179,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> get into different fields <SP1>
5180,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5181,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah yeah yeah like um two summers ago i worked at a coffee shop in san francisco um <SP1>
5182,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> that's chill <SP2>
5183,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i was really chi actually no it wasn't very chill like it was <SP1>
5184,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5185,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> um a very strict coffee shop like i had to wear a tie to work and <SP1>
5186,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> oh really in san francisco <SP2>
5187,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i actually <SP1>
5188,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5189,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> and i actually got fired on like my last week which is like a whole nother complicated story but um like i would get anxious and stressed out and like unhappy because i wasn't like thinking and like <SP1>
5190,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> expanding my horizons and using my brain and <SP1>
5191,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5192,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5193,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i like think that i need to have a certain baseline level of like academic stress at all times or else i like have all this stress ya <SP1>
5194,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah that's that's why i want to do consulting yeah <SP2>
5195,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> it's like the closest thing i can think of to college <SP2>
5196,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5197,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> without still being a college <SP2>
5198,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5199,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah even if it's just perpetual finals period forever <SP2>
5200,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> fair <SP1>
5201,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5202,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> at least you'll like be in it together i assume like will you be working on a team like all consulting together as a team <SP1>
5203,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5204,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> oh yeah and it's great because it's gonna be all kids my age too <SP2>
5205,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's really awesome <SP1>
5206,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> for at least who i come in with <SP2>
5207,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah yeah <SP1>
5208,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5209,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> so do they do like some sort of rotational program to get you on track to know how to consult or how does that work <SP1>
5210,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> they'll probably just throw me on a project <SP2>
5211,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> wow <SP1>
5212,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and that's actually that's what i did this summer <SP2>
5213,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>
5214,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and yeah this summer was actually uh i worked at place called cap gemini in dc <SP2>
5215,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> oh okay i think i've heard of that <SP1>
5216,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and i had never heard of it but apparently it's like two hundred thousand people and i was like eh <SP2>
5217,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> nice <SP1>
5218,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i was i don't even know how i got it actually i don't remember <SP2>
5219,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> but <SP2>
5220,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i'm sure you worked hard to get it <SP1>
5221,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5222,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> but it was just pretty much i they gave us a project where it's like a we work for the government and it said find a government agency and fix it <SP2>
5223,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>
5224,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> wow <SP1>
5225,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> or fix a problem they have yeah <SP2>
5226,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay i'm sure there's a lot of those <SP1>
5227,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and <SP2>
5228,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> actually i wa i ended up working for the biotechnology regulatory service <SP2>
5229,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> oh cool <SP1>
5230,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> so i worked with bio stuff <SP2>
5231,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> nice nice <SP1>
5232,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5233,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> wow how do you like it <SP1>
5234,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> it was first i i worked on a team with the a girl named jing who was out of her mind brilliant but didn't speak any english <SP2>
5235,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5236,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and i worked with a teammate named john who worked remotely in indianapolis <SP2>
5237,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5238,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> hm <SP1>
5239,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> oh wow <SP1>
5240,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> so we were and i was project leader so at first we were incredibly discombobulated <SP2>
5241,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> wow <SP1>
5242,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5243,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> because none of us could communicate in the same area <SP2>
5244,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's nuts <SP1>
5245,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> but just through skype happy hours jing was a homie so i sat next to jing every day <SP2>
5246,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> uh huh <SP1>
5247,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and we had a good time <SP2>
5248,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's nice <SP1>
5249,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> but eventually i i we were looking up everything on the websites for this <SP2>
5250,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5251,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and it was all saying the opposite shit for everything <SP2>
5252,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>
5253,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> so i just started calling like the emergency hotline number at brs and i was like hey there's no emergency but i really need to speak to someone <SP2>
5254,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's crazy and did they connect you with someone <SP1>
5255,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5256,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and it <SP2>
5257,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> eventually they put me in touch with this guy named doctor able who i talked to like every day <SP2>
5258,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>
5259,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> about what was i told him i'm like oh i'm a student at tufts i'm just really interested in it <SP2>
5260,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>
5261,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> oh my gosh do the did they know that you were consulting and fixing your problems <SP1>
5262,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> no <SP2>
5263,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> their problems that's really interesting <SP1>
5264,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i felt really bad about that <SP2>
5265,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's really int so how are you allowed to do that or like who hired you how does that work <SP1>
5266,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> well eventually that we put together this entire huge presentation on it was pretty much whenever let's say monsanto who's a uh <SP2>
5267,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5268,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5269,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5270,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> so let's say they want to change a plant <SP2>
5271,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5272,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and make it drought resistant <SP2>
5273,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> uh huh <SP1>
5274,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> then they're gonna try to augment it in some way with a new phenotype or some type of genetic enhancing <SP2>
5275,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5276,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5277,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> but whenever they go out and experiment it with in the open brs is gonna go and test everything they're doing to make sure it's not harming the environment <SP2>
5278,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>
5279,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> the only thing is they might be like thirty thousand sites across the us and brs incites them randomly <SP2>
5280,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5281,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> okay <SP1>
5282,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> which doesn't make much sense <SP2>
5283,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5284,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> so i was saying you know if we just have i got all this data and i created all these models that say <SP2>
5285,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5286,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> uh huh <SP1>
5287,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> pretty much there are more uh focused ways we can do this based on risk <SP2>
5288,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5289,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and you can go for certain different plant types that you know are more risky <SP2>
5290,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> hm <SP1>
5291,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> huh <SP1>
5292,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and then eliminate half the agency's costs and make it way more efficient and actually purposeful to help <SP2>
5293,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> cool <SP1>
5294,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> a the environment <SP2>
5295,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5296,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> so then we just kinda package this and we gave it to uh i think we may have sent it back to doctor able but i left for that part <SP2>
5297,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> wow <SP1>
5298,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> wow so do you think they're gonna implement it <SP1>
5299,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i hope so it makes a ton of sense <SP2>
5300,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> it does <SP1>
5301,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5302,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5303,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> after going out to the real world i realized like so many things are unecessarily shitty or like extremely poorly run <SP2>
5304,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i agree i agree yeah <SP1>
5305,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and it's just like aw <SP2>
5306,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> and like way too complicated <SP1>
5307,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> man <SP2>
5308,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5309,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> and also like i have a theory that no one actually knows what they're doing <SP1>
5310,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i think that's pretty accurate <SP2>
5311,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> like how do you learn what you're doing i don't know it's just ya i yeah <SP1>
5312,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah i have this increasing view that it's pretty much like children almost never grow up <SP2>
5313,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5314,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> but we just get bigger and start to try to like run the world pretty much <SP2>
5315,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> right <SP1>
5316,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> right right and have to be leaders but like <SP1>
5317,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> but <SP2>
5318,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5319,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> are we even qualified for that <SP1>
5320,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> am yeah so much of it doesn't make so much of finance or even consulting is jargon to confuse laymen to think what we're doing is really smart <SP2>
5321,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm hm <SP1>
5322,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> same thing with medicine <SP1>
5323,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yep <SP1>
5324,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah and a lot of times it's just common sense or just like <SP2>
5325,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5326,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> make a model <SP2>
5327,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5328,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> and figure it out <SP2>
5329,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5330,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5331,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> but it works <SP1>
5332,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah i guess it does work <SP2>
5333,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i mean <SP1>
5334,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5335,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's really neat <SP1>
5336,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> medicine i think is so cool <SP2>
5337,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i also think it's so cool <SP1>
5338,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5339,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i love it um i'm very excited to learn more <SP1>
5340,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> do you know what you would be doing yet <SP2>
5341,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> well i'm going through like phases so like six months ago i was like i'm gonna be an ear nose throat doctor like that's just it that's definitely it um but right now i'm really into gi stuff so like gastro intestinal i think that's really neat <SP1>
5342,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> hm <SP2>
5343,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> um i think the colon is like the coolest part of the body <SP1>
5344,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> um yeah all of my friends always make fun of me like abby says the colon is cool like we should make a poster but <SP1>
5345,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> sure <SP2>
5346,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> could've been a colon for halloween that would've been pretty tight <SP2>
5347,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i should've been oh my god <SP1>
5348,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> that would've been pretty tight <SP2>
5349,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5350,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i was actually um sansa stark from game of thrones though if you watch that we had a great group costume <SP1>
5351,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> oh nice <SP2>
5352,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> um yeah so that's kind of the plan right now i don't know i want to do colonoscopies and like endoscopies and <SP1>
5353,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5354,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> like fix people's stomach issues <SP1>
5355,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> you should have someone nice doing a colonoscopy we need like more probably like the nicest of possible doctors doing colonoscopies <SP2>
5356,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah right <SP1>
5357,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5358,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah definitely <SP1>
5359,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah i mean it like everyone needs them every ten years or five years if they have an elevated risk and like <SP1>
5360,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i've yeah my grandpa had colon cancer so i actually think i have to get one for which i'm really not looking forward to much <SP2>
5361,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mm <SP1>
5362,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> mm <SP1>
5363,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> but yeah <SP2>
5364,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> it'll be fun <SP1>
5365,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah no it will be fun <SP2>
5366,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i mean <SP1>
5367,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> like <SP1>
5368,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i'll pregame it or something <SP2>
5369,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i think that's what the anesthesia's for <SP1>
5370,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> do they give you anesthesia <SP2>
5371,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah yeah <SP1>
5372,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> that's better <SP2>
5373,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5374,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> that'd be a much mor intimate relationship <SP2>
5375,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's much better <SP1>
5376,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah yeah <SP1>
5377,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> otherwise yeah <SP2>
5378,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> although i think some people opt to stay weak and like watch it on the screen which like <SP1>
5379,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> huh <SP2>
5380,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> is interesting to see your own insides on a screen i can't even imagine what that would feel like <SP1>
5381,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> hm <SP2>
5382,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah i'd just be like doc you don't wanna go in there <SP2>
5383,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5384,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah it's nuts but anyway uh when you were talking about like do working for the government with the monsanto stuff like my mom does a lot of um she used to do like genetic modification for um meadwestvaco <SP1>
5385,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> okay <SP2>
5386,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> and they were working on making like more efficient trees <SP1>
5387,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> that's really cool <SP2>
5388,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> but <SP1>
5389,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> now she does like kind of the opposite she does water <SP1>
5390,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5391,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> make trees less efficient <SP2>
5392,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> no no no um she's like the government monitoring she has her own water testing business so she's like monitoring construction companies to making sure make sure that they're not <SP1>
5393,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> hmm <SP2>
5394,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> like <SP1>
5395,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> that's a societally useful useful job <SP2>
5396,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> polluting water <SP1>
5397,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah it's really cool and it's like her own little start up business but <SP1>
5398,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> that's really cool <SP2>
5399,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i was always like raised in this house where we were like really cool with like gmos and like genetic modification and like <SP1>
5400,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5401,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> i don't really know i feel like everything is kind of gmo based cause i mean how i feel like it doesn't really matter something genetically modified because nature genetically modifies everything anyway <SP2>
5402,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> that's a good view point <SP1>
5403,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> so the stigmatization against it i don't really understand <SP2>
5404,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5405,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah i feel like fertilizer that stuff or not fertilizers but uh whatever the chemicals pesticides pesticides i'd be more like <SP2>
5406,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah pesticides <SP1>
5407,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> we shouldn't do that <SP2>
5408,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> right right like i'd rather <SP1>
5409,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5410,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> genetically modify something to be resistant <SP1>
5411,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah then have to give it pesticides to make it okay <SP2>
5412,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5413,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5414,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah i mean i guess it's like really complicated because we don't fully know what everything does to our body at this point <SP1>
5415,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5416,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> so like i don't know <SP1>
5417,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> stick with oreos <SP2>
5418,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> we w yeah we're just <SP1>
5419,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> did you just say stick with oreos <SP1>
5420,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5421,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> you know they're vegan <SP1>
5422,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> really <SP2>
5423,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
5424,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> oh maybe i should've had one <SP2>
5425,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> are you vegan <SP1>
5426,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> no <SP2>
5427,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> i was considering being vegan on and off for awhile <SP1>
5428,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> really <SP2>
5429,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah but i like ice cream too much but now they have vegan ice cream so <SP1>
5430,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> yeah the problem for me is that the difference between vegan and vegetarian is too hard for me to remember so i don't think i could be a good either of them so there's just no way <SP2>
5431,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> really you can't remember <SP1>
5432,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> no so there's just no way i could ever do it it's too complicated <SP2>
5433,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> oh <SP1>
5434,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> it'd be like another level of stress <SP2>
5435,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP1> yeah that's fair i i was vegan for one week <SP1>
5436,2017-10-30-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,6,<SP2> hm <SP2>

5650,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> for english and i wrote a thousand words and realized that i have nothing else to say <SP2>
5651,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> oh that's problematic <SP1>
5652,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> so that's fun <SP2>
5653,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> what um what are you writing about <SP1>
5654,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> we had to choose two op eds about um anything we wanted <SP2>
5655,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5656,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> so i chose <SP2>
5657,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> is this english one <SP1>
5658,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> yeah so i chose one it was actually mine were about the un climate report so one was about um how <SP2>
5659,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> oh so it's like your mom again <SP1>
5660,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> the <SP2>
5661,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> when you know one was like <SP2>
5662,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> like there's nothing we can do like we should just like sit back and wait for like new technology to like be invented <SP2>
5663,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
5664,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> and the other one was like um there's nothing we can really do but we might as well try <SP2>
5665,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> it's like a conflicting argument so where did you fall <SP1>
5666,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> i can't give an opinion it's like a writing about the arguments like just i have to write about which argument is presented better <SP2>
5667,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> oh <SP1>
5668,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> so which one's presented better <SP1>
5669,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> the one that we might as well try <SP2>
5670,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> that's optimistic <SP1>
5671,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> i might be a little biased <SP2>
5672,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> yeah probably <SP1>
5673,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> but <SP2>
5674,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> but yeah someone else in the class chose the same one and they chose the other article <SP2>
5675,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> oh <SP1>
5676,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> so <SP2>
5677,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> that's good so it's definitely arguable <SP1>
5678,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
5679,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> i have to do <SP1>
5680,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> but <SP2>

6054,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> i don't think so <SP2>
6055,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> or is it a french party <SP1>
6056,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> i'm guessing since my teacher told me go to the french house for a soiree <SP2>
6057,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> i mean you could be surprised <SP1>

6059,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> i could be surprised <SP2>
6060,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> the french go wild <SP1>
6061,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> um yeah and then we're doing that but i mean we'll probably do some i don't know i need to find a costume <SP2>

6077,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> and it was like actually very very cool <SP1>
6078,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> that's cool <SP2>
6079,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> and impressive <SP1>
6080,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> see i don't wanna do anything that requires effort <SP2>
6081,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> oh well that's your problem <SP1>
6082,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> i just wanna buy clothes <SP2>

6085,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> you know what you should do wear the unicorn onesie <SP1>
6086,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> oh <SP2>
6087,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> yeah i wonder who yeah that's actually a good idea i'll do that <SP2>
6088,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> you're welcome theresa and i i think i'm gonna go <SP1>
6089,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> so that's kind of a weird first impression to people that i don't know but <SP2>
6090,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> it's a costume you can't go wrong on halloween <SP1>
6091,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> true <SP2>
6092,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> like you really can't <SP1>
6093,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> what are you gonna dress as <SP2>
6094,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> i don't know friday cameron's frat is not having any open parties this weekend <SP1>
6095,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> why can't you still go <SP2>
6096,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> no cause it's like he's not a he's a pledge so he doesn't have like control over it so i'll be going to like i think i'm going to my first tufts frat party <SP1>
6097,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> which is exciting <SP1>

6101,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> it's just <SP2>
6102,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> it's the like i think it's like x o or something like that it's like the howl at the moon or something like that i don't know <SP2>
6103,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> okay well maybe yeah <SP1>
6104,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> it's one of those <SP2>
6105,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> there's another one on saturday i know but i think all i'm gonna do like cause i can't go with cameron cause he has frat stuff most of the weekend <SP1>
6106,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> oh <SP2>
6107,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> so are you gonna be at tufts all weekend <SP2>
6108,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> except for friday <SP1>
6109,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
6110,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> wait what did you i thought you just said that your <SP2>
6111,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> cause i have dinner <SP1>
6112,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> oh <SP2>
6113,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> mm <SP1>
6114,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> and it's like a late dinner but i think grace meghan frankie michelle and i were all gonna do a group costume <SP1>
6115,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> and what we came up with yesterday was well my great idea was over the rainbow like we each be color of the rainbow cause there's like five of us <SP1>
6116,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> it's very five year old but <SP2>
6117,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> it's easy and simple and you probably already have it in your closet <SP1>
6118,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> they didn't like that idea <SP1>
6119,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> they all want to go <SP1>
6120,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> yeah i wonder why <SP2>
6121,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> they wanna go thrift shopping <SP1>
6122,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> and <SP1>
6123,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> yeah that's the most yeah go to goodwill <SP2>
6124,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> no apparently there's one in davis <SP1>
6125,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> what <SP2>
6126,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> there's apparently one in davis <SP1>
6127,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> yes goodwill <SP2>
6128,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> oh is that actually a good will store <SP1>
6129,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> oh maybe it's not i thought it was <SP2>
6130,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> i thought it was just like another thrift store <SP1>
6131,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> there's like three in davis <SP2>
6132,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> really <SP1>
6133,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> oh <SP1>
6134,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
6135,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> i didn't even know i haven't seen any of them <SP1>
6136,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> there's like one that's like there's one good one i forget what they're called there's one good one one that's cool but it's like actually expensive <SP2>
6137,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> isn't that the point like not the point of thrift stores <SP1>
6138,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> so you don't wanna g <SP2>
6139,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> so it's not it's kind of defeats the purpose i mean it's not like expensive expensive but it's more expensive <SP2>
6140,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> okay <SP1>
6141,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> and then there's one that's okay <SP2>
6142,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> i'll go cheap but frankie really wanted to do hippies <SP1>
6143,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> cause frankie wants to buy a pair of bell bottom jeans i think this will be good reason to do it but i don't think i give off a hippie vibe so <SP1>
6144,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> eh <SP2>
6145,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> yeah exactly i don't <SP1>
6146,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> so we'll see what'll happen <SP1>
6147,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> you could do it <SP2>
6148,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> another good idea was we could all go as animals because megan and really wanted to be um a lobster with her boyfriend but he's going home for the weekend <SP1>
6149,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> okay wait okay it takes me a second to think of <SP2>
6150,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> he <SP1>
6151,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> megan's the tall blonde <SP1>
6152,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> the n <SP2>
6153,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> i know i just need to like connect names to faces but i got it now <SP2>
6154,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> okay she um he went home for the weekend so i was like oh let's all the animals cause i have like a good dog outfit and megan could be her lobster and someone was like oh yeah i have a cat outfit and they're like wait megan's like i can't be a lobster and you all be like normal animals <SP1>
6155,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> no th lobster's cool <SP2>
6156,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> yeah but then my idea got shot out the window <SP1>
6157,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> yeah she should yeah she should be a lobster <SP2>
6158,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> so that was a shame <SP1>
6159,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> um someone told me i should be a seagull <SP2>
6160,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> oo that's really creative <SP1>
6161,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> yeah but that's a lot of effort i need to like <SP2>
6162,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> no what would you do <SP1>
6163,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> you should do i really like that idea who said that <SP1>
6164,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> i don't know <SP2>
6165,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> dj <SP2>

6212,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> i'm sure one of your four friends does <SP1>
6213,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> who knows <SP2>
6214,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> um <SP2>
6215,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> there was something funny that happened that i was gonna say <SP2>
6216,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> um what time is it <SP2>
6217,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> it's four ten i don't know how long we've been here should've checked that <SP1>
6218,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> yeah i thought we were getting light refreshments <SP2>
6219,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> oh i know i s the said hot refreshments <SP1>

6227,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> so ten out of ten would recommend <SP1>
6228,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> i didn't realize it was possible to get this excited about pens <SP2>

6240,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> i think we did homework last night but let's not talk about that <SP2>
6241,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> okay <SP1>
6242,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> okay <SP1>
6243,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> um <SP2>
6244,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> um <SP2>
6245,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> do you think i can go to the bathroom <SP1>
6246,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> no <SP2>
6247,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> i should probably wait <SP1>
6248,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> um how many credits do you have now <SP2>
6249,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> um i did the online one like you said that was really comfortable <SP1>

6252,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
6253,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> and then this one'll be that was like i probably have a two and a half <SP1>
6254,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> and so this will be three and a half <SP1>
6255,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> this is i'm at three now i think <SP2>
6256,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> so i'm ahead of you <SP1>
6257,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> and then i think i signed up for one more study <SP1>

6291,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> what's the super g <SP1>
6292,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> it goes shlalom g giant slalom super giant slalom which is super g and then down hill <SP2>
6293,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> so slalom slalom is like quick turns <SP2>

6295,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> giants slalom is like <SP2>
6296,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> i thought those were the bumps <SP1>
6297,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> what are the bumps <SP1>
6298,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> no that's not racing <SP2>
6299,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> mo modals no mo moo <SP1>

6302,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> mobile i was so close <SP1>
6303,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> but that's not in racing <SP2>
6304,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> oh <SP1>
6305,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> racing is just like f just skiing so like slalom is like quick turns <SP2>
6306,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> okay <SP1>

6308,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> are those slaloms the things with the poles <SP1>
6309,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> yeah where you like hit them <SP2>
6310,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> okay <SP1>
6311,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> and then giant slalom <SP2>
6312,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> oh you're supposed to hit them <SP1>

6315,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> but you do normally because if you're hitting them you're closer <SP2>
6316,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> mm <SP1>
6317,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> so you're s it's quicker <SP2>
6318,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> okay <SP1>
6319,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> and then giant slalom is like normal turns <SP2>

6324,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> okay <SP1>
6325,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> miles per hour <SP1>
6326,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> and then <SP2>
6327,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> no <SP1>
6328,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
6329,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> that's not po really <SP1>
6330,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> that seems really dangerous <SP1>
6331,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> yeah well my first race i was so scared because i was like my f and when when i was a freshman my coach is like kind of like a i mean he was like a american ski racer and he's kind of like <SP2>

6334,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
6335,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> so he like when we were he's like yeah this is kind of a tame course i think you'll just be going like sixty miles an hour and i was like trying to pretend to like <SP2>
6336,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> oh yeah totally <SP1>
6337,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> yeah so i was like oh cool and inside i was like <SP2>
6338,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> and inside i was like oh my god <SP2>

6342,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> and then she stops <SP2>
6343,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> wait was like a thing where she like text flicks where she collects snow as she goes and it's like a snowball <SP1>
6344,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> i think you're thinking of an animated movie <SP2>
6345,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> no no you know the car ad it's like an audi car ad the car is like zipping up the mountain and then the snow starts going and it's like misses it every time <SP1>
6346,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> like little snowball and it gets bigger every time <SP1>
6347,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> that doesn't actually happen in real life <SP2>
6348,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP1> no it did in the ad the ad looked real <SP1>
6349,2018-10-23-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,7,<SP2> yeah in the ad <SP2>

6747,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> yeah i never see you <SP1>
6748,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> oh well i always get in <SP2>
6749,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> i get there like right at ten thirty cause i have practice before it <SP2>
6750,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> mm <SP1>
6751,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> okay <SP1>
6752,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> i sit in the back <SP2>
6753,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> huh <SP1>
6754,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> okay <SP1>
6755,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
6756,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> cool <SP1>
6757,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> uh but yeah like uh besides psych i'm in intro to philosophy <SP1>
6758,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> oh do you like that <SP2>
6759,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> uh <SP1>
6760,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> mm <SP1>
6761,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> not really <SP1>
6762,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> cause uh i <SP2>
6763,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> okay you don't like it <SP2>
6764,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> oh i would i don't wanna deter you from taking it <SP1>
6765,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> well i'm on the edge <SP2>
6766,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> i'm just like <SP1>
6767,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> cause i need my english two credit <SP2>
6768,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> okay <SP1>
6769,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> yeah that's why i took it um i would i would say take it like i'm not someone who likes talking and likes discussing things <SP1>
6770,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah i don't either <SP2>
6771,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> but it's a lot of it's a lot of discussion about very abstract abstract topics <SP1>
6772,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> um <SP1>
6773,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> okay <SP2>
6774,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> like i mean it i mean i don't want to say the meaning of life <SP1>
6775,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> but like just very um i dunno things you wouldn't normally think about <SP1>
6776,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> well yeah <SP2>
6777,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> and it's very for me i'm confused most of the time <SP1>
6778,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> but i think most of us are but i think it's good to take it just to branch out <SP1>
6779,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
6780,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> little bit <SP1>
6781,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> um did you have ap english <SP2>
6782,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> yes <SP1>
6783,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
6784,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah we didn't have it so <SP2>
6785,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> oh <SP1>
6786,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> starting at the beginning english one is rough <SP2>
6787,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> yup <SP1>
6788,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> oh it is <SP1>
6789,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah cause they don't they grade so hard cause if you get an a you're done <SP2>
6790,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> aw <SP1>
6791,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> for english two too <SP2>
6792,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> oh so they don't want everyone to get it <SP1>
6793,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> they don't give anyone as <SP2>
6794,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
6795,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
6796,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> that makes sense <SP1>
6797,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
6798,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> aw <SP1>
6799,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> and then i'm taking intro to per principles of economics <SP1>
6800,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> oh i'm taking that next semester <SP2>
6801,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> oh yeah <SP1>
6802,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> do you like it er <SP2>
6803,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> what's the feeling on it <SP2>
6804,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> i think economics is interesting but our professor is crazy <SP1>
6805,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah my roommate's in it and <SP2>
6806,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> oh she yeah <SP1>
6807,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
6808,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> she's just crazy i dunno i like i think it's interesting but i dunno our professor just you can tell she doesn't have a passion for teaching <SP1>
6809,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> oh <SP2>
6810,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> and she she's very like blunt and very rude um she's funny which helps but i just honestly you could probably skip every class <SP1>
6811,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> and the tas really help a lot <SP1>
6812,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> uh huh <SP2>
6813,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> um like she when you ask her a question she just acts like she doesn't want to answer it <SP1>
6814,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
6815,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> but like if you go to your ta they will help you but i'd say definitely take it <SP1>
6816,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> it's good to know <SP1>
6817,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah i think i'm <SP2>
6818,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> um <SP1>
6819,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> gonna do that for sure <SP2>
6820,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
6821,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> and then spanish <SP1>
6822,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> and then my i have an advising course which is financial literacy <SP1>
6823,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> which doesn't sound very exciting <SP1>
6824,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> okay <SP2>
6825,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> but um it's also like another thing another thing that's good to know <SP1>
6826,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> it's like budgeting credit cards <SP1>
6827,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
6828,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> bank accounts and <SP1>
6829,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> uh huh <SP2>
6830,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> all the stuff they don't teach you in high school so <SP1>
6831,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah that's true <SP2>
6832,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> that's smart <SP2>
6833,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
6834,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> but <SP1>
6835,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> do you know what you're gonna major in <SP2>
6836,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> nope i have no idea <SP1>
6837,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah me too me too <SP2>
6838,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> okay good i don't know i'm worried because all my friends i shouldn't say all my friends but most my friends know they wanna do <SP1>
6839,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> a lot of people <SP2>
6840,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> and i'm <SP1>
6841,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
6842,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> just like signing trying to sign up for classes next semester and i just don't <SP1>
6843,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> oh i don't know just don't know what to take <SP1>
6844,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> what are you gonna what do you have like scheduled now <SP2>
6845,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> um <SP1>
6846,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> i have like a lot of har harder classes like bio and calc and <SP1>
6847,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> okay <SP2>
6848,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> and like this semester is easy i'm just like looking at next semester and like cause i don't know if i wanna be pre med <SP1>
6849,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> oh okay <SP2>
6850,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> but i'm just kind of taking bio and calc <SP1>
6851,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
6852,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> just in case <SP1>
6853,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> and i like science too but <SP1>
6854,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
6855,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
6856,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> um bio have you taken like ap chem <SP2>
6857,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> um no i didn't take ap chem <SP1>
6858,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> well cause all my friends are in that are in bio now apparently it's a lot of chem <SP2>
6859,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> so <SP1>
6860,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> it is <SP1>
6861,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> that you need to know first <SP2>
6862,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> oh oh is it bio like f <SP1>
6863,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> which <SP2>
6864,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> cause there's bio fourteen and then bio <SP1>
6865,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> thirteen <SP2>
6866,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> thirteen <SP1>
6867,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> i think i'm doing fourteen <SP1>
6868,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> i <SP2>
6869,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> okay i i don't know which one it is <SP2>
6870,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> okay <SP1>
6871,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> but <SP2>
6872,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> i think it's bio thirteen but that would make sense <SP1>
6873,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> okay <SP2>
6874,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
6875,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> i don't really like chemistry so <SP1>
6876,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah that's why i was not really sure <SP2>
6877,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> i like biology <SP1>
6878,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
6879,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> um i want to take it but i feel like it's gonna be really hard because my school didn't have ap science or anything <SP2>
6880,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> alright <SP1>
6881,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> oh okay <SP1>
6882,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> um and our school like our science curriculum was really weird it was like my school was known as like a science school <SP2>
6883,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
6884,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> but it was just because we had these massive research projects we had to do that and like that took up half of the year and we didn't cover like the actual subject <SP2>
6885,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> oh that's funny <SP1>
6886,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> like <SP2>
6887,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> like i was in bio but like we only probably did half of what like ap bio would've done <SP2>
6888,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> and we just spent time on research projects <SP2>
6889,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> okay <SP1>
6890,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> wow did y so did you wait so you had no ap science classes then <SP1>
6891,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> no <SP2>
6892,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> okay <SP1>
6893,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
6894,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> it's good to know okay <SP1>
6895,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah we didn't have very many ap classes at my high school <SP2>
6896,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> hm <SP1>
6897,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> mkay <SP1>
6898,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> which is weird <SP2>
6899,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> that is cool though that you got to i don't know be a part of like <SP1>

6973,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> and then this is like fifteen minutes from the airport <SP2>
6974,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
6975,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> it's so easy <SP2>
6976,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> exactly <SP1>
6977,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
6978,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah um i'd i like the size i like like the liberal arts i guess <SP2>
6979,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
6980,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> uh yeah <SP2>
6981,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> same like i was um like on like before like this decision day i was between tufts and bowdoin <SP1>
6982,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> okay <SP2>
6983,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> like i really liked bowdoin <SP1>
6984,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah i liked bowdoin too <SP2>
6985,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> but um i was i dunno it's really small <SP1>
6986,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
6987,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> location is not the best <SP1>
6988,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
6989,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> especially in the winter <SP2>
6990,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> there's not not a lot to do <SP1>
6991,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> i feel like <SP2>
6992,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> around <SP1>
6993,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> um so in the end i i can remember having to call the bowdoin coach and like i actually started crying i don't know why but i just like really liked bowdoin but i was like in the end it's like not the best school for me <SP1>
6994,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> but <SP1>
6995,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah i feel like tufts i dunno it's like there's just so much to do <SP2>
6996,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> it's like you're less isolated <SP2>
6997,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
6998,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
6999,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> and it's nice because it has it's own campus and like there's the campus feel but then you can get into the city so easily <SP2>
7000,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
7001,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
7002,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> that's true <SP1>
7003,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP1> and i like oh shoot what was it oh i th i feel like it's gonna be awkward um i don't know about you but like because i applied to like so many schools in the nescac i'm gonna see coaches that i talked to <SP1>
7004,2017-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,8,<SP2> oh yeah <SP2>

7719,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah although i don't know there are easy classes where like the average is pretty low like i'm in this stats class and like pretty easy pretty basic math and the average on the test was like an eighty five <SP2>
7720,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> which you know higher than an eighty but still it's a pretty easy class <SP2>
7721,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> i haven't done like actual math in so long <SP1>

7933,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> like m like my guidance counselor had to write write a note on my application like we don't offer more so then schools won't like just autoreject cause they have like requirements for that like <SP1>
7934,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah huh <SP2>
7935,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> so yeah <SP1>
7936,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> interesting <SP2>
7937,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> and you went to school in the city <SP2>
7938,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> yeah in the lower east side <SP1>
7939,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> mm <SP2>
7940,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> nice <SP2>
7941,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> new york schools are pretty weird so like like they take like old high schools which had like thousands of kids and then they break it down by floor and then those are now different schools <SP1>
7942,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
7943,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> so <SP1>
7944,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> huh <SP2>
7945,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> so it's it's like one floor of a building is a school <SP1>
7946,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> okay <SP2>
7947,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> like my c there was like eighty kids in my class in my graduating class <SP1>
7948,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> huh <SP2>
7949,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> really <SP2>
7950,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah i had half that forty in my c or like forty five <SP2>
7951,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah very small private liberal school in hartford <SP2>
7952,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> um <SP2>
7953,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> and what's yours like six through twelve <SP2>
7954,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> no it was just high school <SP1>
7955,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> okay gotcha mine was six through twelve and we had um in the whole school from the sixth grade to twelfth grade two hundred fifty kids so like extremely small <SP2>
7956,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> and the same guys over and over <SP1>
7957,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah i mean that was ultimately the problem <SP2>
7958,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> good bonds at least right <SP1>
7959,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> with your good friends but then you have people who you don't wanna see around every day but you have classes with them and like you constantly interact with them on a small campus and yeah like by even by the end it junior year i was i was really fed up cause i i didn't come in sixth grade i had been there since seventh but yeah people a lot of the people stay from i mean from six to twelve but or from seven to twelve or you know maybe a couple new people come each year but <SP2>
7960,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah it was essentially the same and you just get really sick of people and teachers too <SP2>
7961,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> they have the same teachers for it <SP1>
7962,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> teachers who you haven't <SP2>
7963,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
7964,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> cause it's a small faculty with two hundred fifty kids you know you can only afford to pay so many people and <SP2>
7965,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> have the same teachers for like six years <SP1>
7966,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> n yeah i mean not every year but you know a teacher you had in ninth grade you might have junior year or a teacher you had in eighth you might have junior year you know just <SP2>
7967,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah which i don't like <SP2>
7968,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> you know and yet people <SP2>
7969,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> i mean i guess that's good for like application to share right <SP1>
7970,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
7971,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> you'll <SP1>
7972,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> you form that that's you know one of the pros of going to a small private school you form good relationships with the profe with the teachers <SP2>
7973,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> um you know good for recommendations and just you know mentoring and stuff but <SP2>
7974,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> in terms of like just being in a bubble you know i think that's you have no independence and like or at least we didn't and yeah just feels like a bubble got really tiring teachers who you've never even had they know your name you know their name you know about them and they know about you and its just yeah <SP2>
7975,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> mm <SP2>
7976,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> my my high school was kinda shitty so it kind of happened like my uh history teacher he taught me every year so <SP1>
7977,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> mm <SP2>
7978,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> huh <SP2>
7979,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> and did you feel that way about at times like no <SP2>
7980,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> na he's he's a cool he's a cool dude <SP1>
7981,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> felt like in a bubble <SP2>
7982,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> so <SP1>
7983,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> really <SP2>
7984,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> nice <SP2>
7985,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> hm <SP1>
7986,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> man these lights are really bright damn <SP2>
7987,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> like <SP2>
7988,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> is this making it like clearer i don't know what i mean you know what i me <SP1>
7989,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> i don't know what the point of it <SP2>
7990,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> there's for like to separate the sound or some shit <SP1>
7991,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> it's for the cam <SP2>
7992,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> i don't know <SP1>
7993,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> for the cameras i guess but yeah i don't know why we need to be in two separate rooms <SP2>
7994,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> like i thought we're it's gonna be it was gonna be con conducted at that table with the food and stuff <SP2>
7995,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> he said they uh they had to separate the voices <SP1>

8039,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> so <SP1>
8040,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> really <SP2>
8041,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> pretty tired <SP1>
8042,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah i went to bed <SP2>
8043,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> i should probably give it some um some context i went to bed at nine last night and woke up at nine today um but reason being the night before i pulled an all nighter and like you know the prior nights i had gotten little very little sleep so i literally was not functioning last night couldn't get any work done you know i had chem lab and then right after didn't even eat dinner just you know went to hodgdon like used my swipe on one of the smoothie things to put in my fridge and then went to bed you know slept basically hours i tried to wake up at am to just crank out work but did not happen <SP2>
8044,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> so <SP2>
8045,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> i hate uh what's it called like having to go to dewick and like waste twenty minutes to like eat a like like that's me spee eat like rushing i can do it in like twenty minutes almost <SP1>
8046,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8047,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> fuck it <SP1>
8048,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah i feel that <SP2>
8049,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> what's your favorite place to eat on campus <SP2>
8050,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> i'd say my default is dewick but <SP1>
8051,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> mm <SP2>
8052,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> do you like hodgdon <SP2>
8053,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> uh sometimes like if lunch is weird and shit then i'll like i don't i don't eat breakfast or dinner at hodgdon so <SP1>
8054,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8055,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> you should try the um the breakfast sandwiches at hodgdon they're pretty good <SP2>
8056,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> gotcha <SP1>
8057,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> like when you're on the go at least you know if you have time to eat a full breakfast of course go to dewick but when you're on the run keep that mind <SP2>
8058,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> gotcha <SP1>
8059,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8060,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> i lived um in hill last year do you know where that is probably through mail services right <SP2>
8061,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> sure <SP1>
8062,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah and um yeah i i hated hill location was terrible you're on the other side of campus you know <SP2>
8063,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yet the closest building to this building which goes to show how just far it is from campus <SP2>
8064,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> i mean at least it's close to the mail right <SP1>
8065,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> that's the only advantage <SP2>
8066,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> the the <SP1>
8067,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> like i could walk out of my room and get mail right away but how much mail do you <SP2>
8068,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> the fact that like you know like the advantage of getting shit delivered is you don't gotta get up so like you gotta go all the way there's no like purpose <SP1>
8069,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah true but yeah for me i didn't get that much mail i don't order that much so i maybe got ten packages the whole year maybe fifteen <SP2>
8070,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> if you're getting ten a week <SP2>
8071,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> like i use i use amazon for like groceries and shit <SP1>
8072,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> you know <SP2>
8073,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> like i'm like i don't wanna like <SP1>
8074,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> oh okay <SP2>
8075,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> okay <SP2>
8076,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> and i'm like no i gotta like i might as well fuck go to fucking what is it go to davis or some shit <SP1>
8077,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah i could see that then for me i i don't order that much only when i need to so that wasn't a big advantage for me and the gym people say hill is closer closer cause you wake down walk you could walk down boston ave um you know but honestly i'm in haskell now and it's not that much farther maybe two minutes <SP2>
8078,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> i don't really go to the gym <SP1>
8079,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> further <SP2>
8080,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> so like <SP1>
8081,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> i don't anymore really but last year when i did you know yeah not that much so yeah hill hill was terrible didn't really like the people i lived with beside from my roommate maybe a couple other people and <SP2>
8082,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> me and my roommate barely even talk it's <SP1>
8083,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> who is your roommate <SP2>
8084,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> ethan i don't it's not like you're gonna know him <SP1>
8085,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> what's yeah out of curiosity <SP2>
8086,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> uh ethan <SP1>
8087,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> ethan <SP2>
8088,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> uh zaharoni is that wrong <SP1>
8089,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> huh <SP2>
8090,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> something like that <SP1>
8091,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> don't know him huh <SP2>
8092,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> hm <SP1>
8093,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> and you just don't get along or quiet guy <SP2>
8094,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> i mean we're both kinda like quiet guys so it's kinda weird <SP1>
8095,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> mm <SP2>
8096,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> we don't really uh <SP1>
8097,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> he's a nice dude though so <SP1>
8098,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah that's good just as long as you get along you know <SP2>

8100,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> i have a friend who went to tufts he's like twenty six or some shit <SP1>
8101,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> okay <SP2>
8102,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> he says he like still like meets up with his uh freshman roommate he like saw his kids and stuff <SP1>
8103,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> really <SP2>

8105,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> wow <SP2>
8106,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> like sure <SP1>
8107,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah yeah my room my freshman year roommate just i don't know not the best at staying in touch like i hit him up for dinner you know early on in the semester and we got dinner and then yeah he didn't really hit me up after that so <SP2>
8108,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> but yeah when i walk by him we say hey and talk he's a chill dude <SP2>
8109,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> but just kinda quiet and he has you know like this one his roommate is like his best friend and they kind of do their own thing <SP2>
8110,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah so <SP2>
8111,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> how much time has surpassed <SP2>
8112,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> i don't know it it this felt it's been a while right <SP1>
8113,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> i think last i checked it was four fifty i think <SP2>
8114,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> which would make it have been twenty five minutes <SP2>
8115,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> twenty six <SP1>
8116,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> so we got like five minutes right <SP1>
8117,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> hopefully <SP2>
8118,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> okay <SP1>
8119,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> if if it was four fifty when i checked ma might have been like four fifty five <SP2>
8120,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> they got fake plants <SP1>
8121,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> never been in a position where like i need to talk <SP2>
8122,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> be pretty funny if we just didn't talk <SP2>
8123,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> facts they'd be like what the fuck <SP1>
8124,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> just <SP2>
8125,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> let's let's talk shit about that dude <SP1>
8126,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> he's gonna watch he's like the fuck <SP1>
8127,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> i think he is watching is he <SP2>
8128,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> is he watching right now <SP1>
8129,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> i don't think he's watching right now <SP1>
8130,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> mm i don't know <SP2>
8131,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> did he did he say that <SP2>
8132,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> i don't know <SP1>
8133,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> thought he did maybe maybe not <SP2>
8134,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> hopefully not <SP1>
8135,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> feel like he would be because or at least yeah i feel like he would because in case something went wrong or like <SP2>
8136,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> like we choked on the wires or some shit like <SP1>
8137,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8138,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> y yeah i don't know <SP2>
8139,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> hm <SP1>
8140,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> i was also i think there are mirrors too on the doors <SP1>
8141,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> the the window in the door <SP1>
8142,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> oh yeah shit see you can't i thought that was a window <SP2>
8143,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> yeah i'm like wait why is it <SP1>
8144,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> shit <SP2>
8145,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> damn i wonder if's the the type where like you can look in from the outside but it's a mirror <SP2>
8146,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
8147,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> y there's like a trick where you like touch i don't know it's like your your if your finger hovers or something <SP1>
8148,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> really <SP2>
8149,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
8150,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> i haven't heard of that huh <SP2>
8151,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> like it shouldn't be like on it there should be some space i don't know <SP1>
8152,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> okay <SP2>
8153,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> probably looking in right now then <SP2>
8154,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> you want to test it <SP1>
8155,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> hm <SP1>
8156,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> oh man <SP2>
8157,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> i am ready for the weekend <SP2>
8158,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> facts <SP1>
8159,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> man i i <SP2>
8160,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> i heard these things are like really expensive <SP1>
8161,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> really <SP2>
8162,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> yeah the these parts <SP1>
8163,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> this is what they wear like you know <SP2>
8164,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> like you know like <SP1>
8165,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> ted talks and stuff <SP2>
8166,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
8167,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> and <SP2>
8168,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> they're like seven hundred bucks or some shit <SP1>
8169,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> really <SP2>
8170,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
8171,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> shit i mean it is like a small piece <SP2>
8172,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> i wonder if they have like different like colors for races <SP1>
8173,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> so it makes sense <SP2>
8174,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> like black people get darker <SP1>
8175,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> oh they have to yeah i'm sure they do <SP2>
8176,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> or at least just black and white you know <SP2>
8177,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> but <SP2>
8178,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> hm <SP1>
8179,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah this is gonna be an interesting story to tell <SP2>
8180,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> this is like not what i <SP2>
8181,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> what i expected <SP2>
8182,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> didn't why don't give like descriptions of what you're gonna do beforehand <SP1>
8183,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8184,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> like <SP1>
8185,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> i kinda <SP2>
8186,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> like i have like what if they're gonna strap like shit to my head like i don't know <SP1>
8187,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8188,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> for the like brain shit i don't know <SP1>
8189,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> but <SP1>
8190,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> hm <SP1>
8191,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> um <SP2>
8192,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah you have any ideas what to talk about <SP2>
8193,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> the shape of the table's kind of weird <SP1>
8194,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> forms a pentagon <SP2>
8195,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> hexagon <SP1>
8196,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> hexagon <SP2>
8197,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
8198,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah oh i'm out of it <SP2>
8199,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> hm <SP1>
8200,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> they have it like perfectly aligned <SP2>
8201,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> it's kinda weird like aside from seeing each other it looks like it's a mirror <SP2>
8202,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
8203,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> almost you know <SP2>
8204,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> hm <SP1>
8205,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> although you <SP2>
8206,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> what what could be the purpose of this <SP1>
8207,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah it literally is the same <SP2>
8208,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah wait a minute <SP2>
8209,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> it's like the same um <SP2>
8210,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> set up <SP2>
8211,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> literally like look at the yellow <SP2>
8212,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> and then they they separate our our voices right so it's like we're hearing our selves like we're talking to a mirror i'm like oh my god <SP1>
8213,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> yeah it's actually yeah look at the yellow under the at the bottom of the camera they have that on both sides <SP2>
8214,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> the fuck <SP1>
8215,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> it honestly is like it's a whole <SP2>
8216,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> let's see if the let's see if they made any mistakes there's one unplugged i think <SP1>
8217,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> yeah mine's wrapped yours isn't wrapped <SP1>
8218,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> like see th yours is on the floor <SP1>
8219,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> where <SP2>
8220,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> mines is wrapped up there <SP1>
8221,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> oh yeah <SP2>
8222,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> so now we know it's not a mirror <SP2>
8223,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> or maybe it's a game like we have to find the l oh look my thing's different <SP1>
8224,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> for the for the <SP1>
8225,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> it is <SP2>
8226,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> it's pointed that <SP2>
8227,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> it is a game <SP1>
8228,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> i actually for a second thought like wait is there way they made like every thing a mirror <SP2>
8229,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> hm <SP1>
8230,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> except us like look at the table it's like perfect you know everything is perfect except <SP2>
8231,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> but no yeah you're right there are differences <SP2>
8232,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> or maybe he just fucked up when he was setting it up <SP1>
8233,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> they clearly tried to make it perfect though <SP2>
8234,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> i mean they're not i mean the they're like pretty far apart too and these are pretty close <SP1>
8235,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> i mean like it <SP2>
8236,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> true yeah that's another thing <SP2>
8237,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> hm <SP1>
8238,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> i wonder what that yeah what that yellow thing is to trip you up clearly <SP2>
8239,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> exact <SP1>
8240,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> cause what else would that be there for <SP2>
8241,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> you have like a little edge <SP1>
8242,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> mine don mine doesn't have a ledge like next to the door <SP1>
8243,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> oh yeah yeah you're right <SP2>
8244,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> hm <SP1>
8245,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP2> man this is like mind this is <SP2>
8246,2017-11-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,9,<SP1> the fuck is going on <SP1>

8316,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> it's really it's really rough <SP1>
8317,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> i i like can't get over this setting this is just really funny <SP2>
8318,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> this is wait we have like the same painting too <SP1>
8319,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> oh my god and it's like directly like directly flipped <SP2>
8320,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and the same tree and like that <SP1>
8321,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> although my my my light is like more wide open <SP1>
8322,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> oh that's true maybe like that's why the it looks like like a mirror image cause like <SP2>
8323,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> it cause it's literally the exact same <SP1>
8324,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> it's literally yeah it's just flipped <SP2>
8325,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> that's so weird i'm actually really tripped up by this <SP1>
8326,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> even we have like the same tree too <SP2>
8327,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> we have the same tree the same curtains can i can i just like i can like close it on you <SP1>
8328,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> well you have the table <SP2>
8329,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> yeah that's true that's so er i'm like i'm i'm just like thrown by this that's all <SP1>
8330,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> oh my god yeah <SP2>
8331,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> s <SP2>
8332,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> i wonder how many times they will like get a conversation that's like really self aware of the fact that they're in the study <SP1>
8333,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> prolly like every single time right <SP1>
8334,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah i feel like i feel like every conversation probably has some discussion about that <SP2>
8335,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> yeah it's <SP1>
8336,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> cause it's like like how do you not pay attention to the setting <SP2>
8337,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> yeah especially like tufts students too they like to pick apart everything <SP1>
8338,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> cause we're quirky <SP2>
8339,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> we're so quirky <SP1>
8340,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> we're the quirkiest <SP2>
8341,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> oh my god <SP1>
8342,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> this setting is quirky <SP2>
8343,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> this is a very quirky setting i like the painting though it's very pretty <SP1>
8344,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8345,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> it's like the snow on it and everything <SP1>
8346,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8347,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> makes me want to go skiing <SP1>
8348,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> it makes me feel very relaxed <SP2>
8349,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> yeah i don't know it's like <SP1>
8350,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> and like it also makes me want to like have like hot chocolate and like sit in front of a fireplace <SP2>
8351,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> mm <SP1>
8352,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> oh my god that's why i like the rain so much <SP1>
8353,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8354,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> like it doesn't rain a lot in california and it's always like really nice ti nice weather so when it does rain you just li you go inside and everything and it's you like get a hot chocolate and you like bundle up and you sit it front of a fire <SP1>
8355,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> i wish <SP2>
8356,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> there's no fires at tufts and it really pisses me off <SP1>
8357,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> there's too many fires in california <SP2>
8358,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> no like fire like fireplaces <SP1>
8359,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> oh yeah i haven't seen a single one <SP2>
8360,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> yeah i know <SP1>
8361,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> do any of like the c i mean i guess it would be like a fire hazard <SP2>
8362,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> why <SP1>
8363,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> cause we're a bunch of eighteen year olds playing with fire <SP2>
8364,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> what they put a fireplace in my high school <SP1>
8365,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> really <SP2>
8366,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
8367,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> what kind of high schol did you go to <SP2>
8368,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and that was a bunch of fourteen to eighteen year olds <SP1>
8369,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> i went to i went to a weird high school it was like a it was a real techy high school <SP1>
8370,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> my god <SP2>
8371,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> but there was a fire place there <SP1>
8372,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> damn <SP2>
8373,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and it was very cozy to like sit by there <SP1>
8374,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> damn <SP2>
8375,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> but then people would turn it on in the spring and it would be like really hot <SP1>
8376,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and people would be like why the fuck what why would you do that <SP1>
8377,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> oh my god <SP2>
8378,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> that'd be a good like senior <SP2>
8379,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> i feel like i should not cuss at the in this thing <SP1>
8380,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> no man go for it <SP2>
8381,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> i realize that <SP1>
8382,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> no but like i i don't know i don't want to like i gotta keep i got to keep it campy i i can't like i can't be like i i don't know i just feel like they don't want that kind of <SP1>
8383,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah did you guys have a senior prank in high school <SP2>
8384,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> oh we did <SP1>
8385,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> oh we did <SP1>
8386,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> we we tried like cause every year they have one that we tried so hard to do one but like people's ideas were either so weird or so illegal like someone was like oh cause we have um like the faculty parking lot and we have like a student parking lot so people were like oh let's like park all of our cars in the faculty parking lot but like i don't want to get my car towed <SP2>
8387,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> yeah no def <SP1>
8388,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> and then like another idea was like oh let's have like like a purge in the school but my high school is seventh through twelfth grade <SP2>
8389,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> oh god no you can't do that <SP1>
8390,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> so you have twelve year olds in my school <SP2>
8391,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> yeah no that's bad <SP1>
8392,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> and i'm like i'm not about to scar a bunch of twelve year olds <SP2>
8393,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> yeah i'm not i'm not messing with that <SP1>
8394,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah and then another idea was like like a splish like a slip and slide not splish splash slip and slide through the hallway <SP2>
8395,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> oo that's a that's a good one <SP1>
8396,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> and like that <SP2>
8397,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> but like that's also like like we would flood the whole school <SP2>
8398,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> that's really annoying to clean up <SP1>
8399,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah and like the whole school would be flooded <SP2>
8400,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> cause like our building is like kind of old <SP2>
8401,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> we d <SP1>
8402,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> we did like a lot of things for our senior prank we did li um one of the big ones was was so we have like our high school and then like a twenty minute drive away there's like the m the accompanying middle school <SP1>
8403,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
8404,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> so these two these se these seniors basically piled in a car went to the middle school kidnapped a metal dinosaur <SP1>
8405,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> oh my god <SP2>
8406,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> that they had in the middle school and drove it all the way back <SP1>
8407,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> oh my god <SP2>
8408,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> so this giant metal dinosaur is just in the middle of the hallway <SP1>
8409,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> i i love that <SP2>
8410,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> which is <SP1>
8411,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> it was really great <SP1>
8412,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> um <SP2>

8566,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> oh my gosh <SP1>
8567,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> this is this is i'm like hyper aware of the fact that this is here <SP2>
8568,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> i i don't know well now i'm aware of it cause you mentioned it but i wasn't before <SP1>
8569,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> it's it's it's weird <SP2>
8570,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> the friend i'm meeting tonight for dinner um he's a really crazy driver <SP1>
8571,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> mhm <SP2>

8573,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> it's like a it's a pretty small car <SP1>
8574,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8575,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> it's like it's like kind of a prius but they like compressed it and it like sorta went up as a result <SP1>
8576,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
8577,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> like on the on photoshop you like to drag the box in and it like extends out on the top <SP1>
8578,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> so like a <SP2>
8579,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> that's basically what the car is <SP1>
8580,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> so does it look like a box <SP2>
8581,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> it's kind of like a box it kinda looks like a computer mouse <SP1>
8582,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> honestly <SP1>
8583,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> e ugh <SP2>
8584,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and he it's a fine car though it's act i like i love driving it <SP1>
8585,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8586,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and <SP1>
8587,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8588,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> it's got like really good acceleration and really good handling so when he's driving on the highway to school um he's going like really fast the whole time and like weaving in and out of traffic and everything <SP1>
8589,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and it it's the single most terrifying thing to experience <SP1>
8590,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
8591,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> oh my god <SP2>
8592,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> cause i'm sitting in the front and like all of a sudden he'll just like floor it and go like ninety miles an hour c like go ahead of this one car and then like change lanes again and i i got like so numb to it by the end i would like sit in i would be like sitting in the front <SP1>
8593,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> oh my god <SP2>
8594,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and he'd be doing it <SP1>
8595,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and like another friend will be sitting in the back and they'd be like clenching their seat really freaked out and i'd just be like ho hum <SP1>
8596,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> wait how far were you from your high school where you had to use the highway <SP2>
8597,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> it was a twenty minute drive we used to take the train <SP1>
8598,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> really <SP2>
8599,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
8600,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> oh damn <SP2>
8601,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> um in freshman sophomore and part of junior year i would take the train every single day <SP1>
8602,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
8603,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> um <SP1>
8604,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and yeah it w like that was like a that was like a twenty minute train ride um and then once like everyone got like cars they could drive and got a license um we started car pooling and stuff <SP1>
8605,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
8606,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> but by by the end of it i started driving myself cause it was really relaxing to be able to like listen to my own music <SP1>
8607,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8608,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and everything on the highway <SP1>
8609,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> that's true <SP2>
8610,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah i know mine was like a five minute drive but um yeah i would just like have my mom drive me um and then like when i got my license i would like drive myself <SP2>
8611,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> yeah my my parents never drove me cause my dad was busy and my mom doesn't drive on highways <SP1>
8612,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8613,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah yeah we didn't even need highways but it was like it kind of sucked cause i wasn't able to drive all the time cause like i didn't have my own car i'd have my dad's car so i can like only like use it if my mom wasn't working and then my dad would take her van and i would take my dad's car <SP2>
8614,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> so that and that was the only thing that worked <SP1>
8615,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8616,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> i m so <SP1>
8617,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8618,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> uh yeah i had like the a car that was like designated for like me and my brother even though anyone in the family would drive it <SP1>
8619,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
8620,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and um my brother couldn't drive it until like the summer but once he could it got really annoying cause i just wouldn't have the car available <SP1>
8621,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8622,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and like in the summer it was like senior year it was like the summer after senior year so i was doing like the most driving and i was going to like the most places i'd ever like gone to before so it was like it was really annoying where i'd be like oh yeah i'm trying to go to like this friend's house this afternoon my mom's like na he my brother your brother took it to football <SP1>
8623,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> that that's what happened to me cause like my dad was gonna get um a new car and then his current car was gonna become mine and my brothers then like we ended up going to europe so then we like like that money was spent on europe but um yeah like like the whole summer i would be like oh like i need the car and then my brother would be like oh like i'm taking it <SP2>
8624,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> no i need it this is my car <SP1>
8625,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> and i was like no and like it sucked cause like he was older than me so he like he did get priority <SP2>
8626,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> that's annoying <SP1>
8627,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> and i was like ugh yeah <SP2>
8628,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> i don't know now now like most of my friends just drive <SP1>
8629,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> it's it's fine <SP1>
8630,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah and like i had a i had a lot of friends who like had their own cars so they were just drive me places <SP2>
8631,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> yeah i feel like most people in new york don't really drive around though most of the people i've talked to haven't really like gotten their licenses <SP1>
8632,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> it it depends where you're from like from the city like there's no point if you're from the city there's really no point in getting your license <SP2>
8633,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> cause you're not gonna drive in the city but like long island like <SP2>
8634,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
8635,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> but like it's good to have your license <SP1>
8636,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8637,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> sooner rather than later <SP1>
8638,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah like everyone in long island has their license <SP2>
8639,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> yeah driving w driving on like the highways is like definitely like one of my favorite things to do <SP1>
8640,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah yeah <SP2>
8641,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and like in california there's this one highway where it's it like runs all it's sort of like runs through these like hills and it's really beautiful <SP1>
8642,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
8643,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and there's like fog rolling over them and everything so it's just like a really cool place to drive in <SP1>
8644,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8645,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> like you can go really fast there cause there's like there's no cars <SP1>
8646,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8647,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and also there's no cops so you can go like way faster and they don't really care <SP1>
8648,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> um so i would drive like eighty fi eighty eighty five just like constantly <SP1>
8649,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> to get to places <SP1>
8650,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah yeah yeah i know it's definitely rela relaxing but like the only time i would really go on the highway is like driving from like driving to and from work i would use the highway and then like if i would just go to jersey with my parents i would drive on the highway <SP2>
8651,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> you'd do the driving for that <SP1>
8652,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8653,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> well i would drive home cause usually like my dad would be like oh i'm going there we'd have like we have to be there by a certain time so i'll drive but it's like stressful at night <SP2>
8654,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> oh definitely <SP1>
8655,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> like cause it <SP2>
8656,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> night driving on the highway with a lot of cars around is really stressful <SP1>
8657,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8658,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> it's like it would always like make me really anxious and it would take me like half an hour until like i got the hang of it <SP2>
8659,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
8660,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8661,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> but like usually i would just drive on local roads cause i never really like needed the highway <SP2>
8662,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> we w <SP1>
8663,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> that's fair we would drive up to we drive up to lake taho whole lot <SP1>
8664,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
8665,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and the dri like the first half is just like long boring highway driving <SP1>
8666,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8667,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> but the second half is like really windy like two lane highways with a lot of like giant trucks and it's like really sketchy <SP1>
8668,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
8669,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> like you've got a wall on one side and like a cliff on the other it's like really freaky <SP1>
8670,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8671,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and um like i i learned how to do that driving eventually and it was it's you need to be like focused and locked in like twenty four seven <SP1>
8672,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8673,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> when you're doing that <SP1>
8674,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> and like i just like i tend to like zone out when i'm driving and either like i like pay attention to music or i'll just like relax too much <SP2>
8675,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> yeah i can't do that <SP1>
8676,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> so like highway driving like i'm like i need to pay attention to everything happening <SP2>
8677,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> mhm and when you're doing it at night you like get you get drowsy <SP1>
8678,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah yeah yeah exactly <SP2>
8679,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> so like my dad like he like n he never really let me drive on the highway unless he was with me or if my mom was with me but like i wouldn't be allowed to drive on the highway by myself <SP2>
8680,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> i think the dmv called it like highway hypnosis or something like that i don't even know i don't even know why i still remember that <SP1>
8681,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> that makes <SP2>
8682,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> that makes sense that makes a lot of sense yeah i like don't understand how people iike still don't have their license like i literally got mine like the week after i turned sixteen <SP2>
8683,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> really <SP1>

8866,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> like i like being in like control of my own time and being able to like choose when i do things <SP2>
8867,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> mm <SP1>
8868,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> and when i don't do things <SP2>
8869,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> yeah it's like i don't know on tuesdays and thursdays it's like kind of a rough day but i between my first class and my second class there's straight up three hours <SP1>
8870,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
8871,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> where i can just like chill and do homework <SP1>
8872,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8873,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah like i like nine thirty was like earlier than i because i wanted to start at ten thirty <SP2>
8874,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> i'm starting at ten thirty every single day <SP1>
8875,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> i wish like mondays i start at one thirty <SP2>
8876,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> really <SP1>
8877,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
8878,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> i'd take like i'd take a nine thirty as opposed to a ten thirty if it meant i could sleep until one thirty on like tuesdays or something <SP1>
8879,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah it's it's nice cause like mondays i start late and then fridays i end early and like it's hard like waking up at nine thirty but like it's m it's not like eight thirty like it's manageable still <SP2>
8880,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> yeah eight thi i i'm i made sure not to take any friday classes and not to take any eight thirties <SP1>
8881,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah i wasn't gonna take a friday class but like it just happened i like my spanish class was on a friday which is fine cause like it's just nine thirty to ten twenty so like after that i'm fine <SP2>
8882,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> and like <SP2>
8883,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> and then you're free for the day <SP1>
8884,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP2> yeah i like normally like on fridays i would probably like wake up at ten thirty anyway so the fact that i'm done by ten twenty like it's it's so manageable <SP2>
8885,2018-10-27-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,10,<SP1> i mean i w i sleep till noon on fridays i don't know about you but <SP1>

8943,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> it's not that like the material is all that difficult but it's a lot of like you know figuring out what it's all about like mutations so like they'll give you a pathway and they'll say like alright if i break this receptor what happens <SP1>
8944,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> uh huh <SP2>
8945,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> if now i you know change and i mix two different kinds of receptors what's gonna happen then <SP1>

9021,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> the new choreo so what they do is like a banghra is made divided into segments <SP1>
9022,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9023,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so like you will have you know a slow segment you will have um and then all the other fast segments two of them are like props so you you have props that you use you'll see when you um w i w if you watch the performance <SP1>
9024,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9025,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> um and then so that's one <SP1>
9026,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> that's three <SP1>
9027,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and then <SP1>
9028,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> like the like this thing <SP2>
9029,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> that <SP1>
9030,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9031,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and then we also have like these giant like pvc pipe like we we use pvc pipe but th they're like they're sticks <SP1>
9032,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9033,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and you know you dance and it's like s just supposed to add color and loudness to the performance <SP1>
9034,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah yeah <SP2>
9035,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> right <SP1>
9036,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and so <SP1>
9037,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> um yeah so that so apart from the slow segment and those two the other you can figure out how many ever you want a typical dance is like eight eight minutes long so to fit that time you can decide and usually it's based around a single type of move so like you know the each segment is named after a different kind of move so like this move is called dhammal and you know you can build a second around that <SP1>
9038,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9039,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and so you know e like we keep one or two segments from year to year so that we can actually like because we also have one or two performance in the first semester <SP1>
9040,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> right so we can't just re learn a h completely new thing in the first month <SP1>
9041,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9042,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah yeah <SP2>
9043,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so the um all the returners will usually dance the first fully using the previous year's set and the newbies will learn like one or two segments from it <SP1>
9044,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9045,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> e you know time permitting and so um we l f for first two performances we learned like two of the segments <SP1>
9046,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9047,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and then after that everything else was new so us and the new uh the returners were on the same page yeah so um it's not it's like the what where the returners have like the advantage <SP1>
9048,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> it was like something floating around <SP1>
9049,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> um where the returners have like the advantage is that um they've learned how to do the moves <SP1>
9050,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> it's alright <SP2>
9051,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9052,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and they've seen many of the same moves there's only so many moves you can do <SP1>
9053,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> right right right <SP2>
9054,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> just in different combinations <SP1>
9055,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> right <SP2>
9056,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yep <SP2>
9057,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so they've all they've seen all the moves they know how to do all the moves for them it's just remembering the choreo <SP1>
9058,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> for us it's not only remembering the choreo but like figuring out how do the moves <SP1>
9059,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah right <SP2>
9060,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> it's like basketball <SP2>
9061,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9062,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> like you know a screen roll <SP2>
9063,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> but where does it yeah <SP2>
9064,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9065,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> that's interesting wait how many times do you have to meet a week every <SP2>
9066,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> we do so last semester we did two times a week for two hours so four hours total <SP1>
9067,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> okay <SP2>
9068,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> did you do you get a credit for it or no <SP2>
9069,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> no it's a club <SP1>
9070,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> it's just just an extracurricular <SP2>
9071,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> it's a club yeah <SP1>
9072,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> gotcha <SP2>
9073,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah so it's uh but i guess the nice thing is they try to keep most practices on like the weekends <SP1>
9074,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> we have one like on a tuesday <SP1>
9075,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mm <SP2>
9076,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> which kinda sucks <SP1>
9077,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9078,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> but it's also like from ten to midnight <SP1>
9079,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9080,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so it's like y you're not gonna get anything done then <SP1>
9081,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah yeah right right <SP2>
9082,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so <SP1>
9083,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> especially if you have class the next day <SP1>
9084,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> and then it amps up like now when the performance is <SP2>
9085,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah now we have three <SP1>
9086,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9087,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> three days a week so six hours a week <SP1>
9088,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9089,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> um in addition to there's also like a a f an o uh what is it called open bhangra where like all the newbies choreograph a dance <SP1>
9090,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so we've we've been like h hosting practices for other people who want to do that <SP1>
9091,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9092,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> huh it's probably nice too it's this like is it exercise like does it <SP2>
9093,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> oh yeah absolutely <SP1>
9094,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah yeah <SP2>
9095,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> it's very physical yeah <SP1>
9096,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> oh <SP2>
9097,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> that's good then <SP2>
9098,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> it's all jumping <SP1>
9099,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9100,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> it's all jumping <SP1>
9101,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> interesting i should come see it wait the twenty third where is it <SP2>
9102,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> cohen <SP1>
9103,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so it's on campus <SP1>
9104,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> oh nice <SP2>
9105,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9106,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah yeah <SP2>
9107,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah and you'll you'll get to see all the south asian teams so it's the it's the south asian culture show <SP1>
9108,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9109,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> um and so <SP1>
9110,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> oh okay gotcha <SP2>
9111,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9112,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> cause eh like what other teams dance <SP2>
9113,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so we have uh i think we have four indian dance teams and then of course all like the different combinatorial dances so like we have like a freshman all all freshman on the team dance sophomore dance senior dance junior dance plus like this open bhangra thing we're doing so we have like all these side dances <SP1>
9114,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> but the four main teams are bhangra ras which is like um like a north indian dance that's like more about like jumping around and and they kind of use like little sticks and it's a lot of it's supposed to be based off one of our gods krishna <SP1>
9115,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9116,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mm <SP2>
9117,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> i think um and it's like <SP1>
9118,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> karishma <SP2>
9119,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> no no <SP1>
9120,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and it's like um it's supposed to be you know h hype but very cultural at the same time <SP1>
9121,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9122,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> like you know ours is punjabi not really like indian so it's it's punjabi up north and it's a very distinctive style this is like gucharathi it's a dif dis distinctive style then we have the classical dance team which is pulse that's from where where my state in india where i'm from <SP1>
9123,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9124,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> um which is the you know like the class indian classical dance which a lot of my friends and family members have grown up doing so i've had exposure to it but you know you typical guys do it but typically they don't do it <SP1>
9125,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mm <SP2>
9126,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so i never ended up doing it <SP1>
9127,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm mhm <SP2>
9128,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> it's m more usually for like this team is all girls but guys do do it <SP1>
9129,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9130,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9131,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and then the fourth team is the bollywood fusion team s t uh so tamasha <SP1>
9132,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> gotcha <SP2>
9133,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah and they the sad thing about them is like most schools have pretty stocked bollywood dance teams and like some of the dances and stuff they got like bc has a really really good bollywood fusion team <SP1>
9134,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9135,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> um and the thing about bollywood fusion it's supposed to combine many different styles so but th what they'll do is they'll dance to like contemporary folk music and they'll come up with some really really cool moves and then they also have a banghra segment usually at the end <SP1>
9136,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> oh woah <SP2>
9137,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> because banghra's supposed to be so hype they want to close it out <SP1>
9138,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and they do like the most hype moves <SP1>
9139,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah yeah yeah <SP2>
9140,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9141,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> from banghra sets and then they close it out <SP1>
9142,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> wow <SP2>
9143,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> um and then yeah but the thing is our team like is all girls and there's only they only have like six people six or seven people for some reason i don't know why but yeah and then so each of us will do our dances and then like all the freshmen will do the dance and sophomores will do the dance and senior juniors seniors <SP1>
9144,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> oh gotcha wow that's a th that's a long show <SP2>
9145,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> holy cow <SP2>
9146,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9147,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> dang <SP2>
9148,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> but most other i would say like most other performances are pretty short <SP1>
9149,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9150,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> like tamasha none of them cross four minutes we're the longest ones just because of the nature of and like the the culture of the dance <SP1>
9151,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9152,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> like it's supposed to be a certain <SP1>
9153,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9154,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> but yeah <SP1>
9155,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> interesting <SP2>
9156,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> what are you up to this weekend <SP1>
9157,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> i just have to study too i have yeah social psych monday psych stats wednesday and then proctor's class <SP2>
9158,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> oh <SP1>
9159,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> the exam on friday <SP2>
9160,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> i hope you know those take a while right <SP1>
9161,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> oh yeah <SP2>
9162,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9163,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah no i i have <SP2>
9164,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> like four hours <SP1>
9165,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah i ha <SP2>
9166,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> four hours <SP2>
9167,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> it took me al more uh the first one took me three and a half second one took me five and a half third one took me almost six <SP1>
9168,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> whoa he said two <SP2>
9169,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah d i i told you right one thing he's not good about is judging time <SP1>
9170,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> is estimating <SP2>
9171,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9172,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> or amount <SP1>
9173,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> although maybe he's good oh i guess we're being recorded but maybe he's good at like judging time for you know people at the back of the class you know who who who no but people who maybe are not as like <SP2>
9174,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah i think that he like the fact that he gives you no upper limit and just kind of like take however long you want so p most people most people are just kind of sit there and and because y think about it right like the how many ever pages your essay was you're regurgitating that <SP1>
9175,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah it kinda insinuates <SP2>
9176,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9177,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> right <SP1>
9178,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> right and it took me six hours to write that <SP2>
9179,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and some <SP1>
9180,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah and like i mean of course now you'll have less time because you know obviously i think that he wants you to cut it down <SP1>
9181,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9182,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> right <SP1>
9183,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> well and you can't cite <SP2>
9184,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and you can't <SP1>
9185,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> that's what takes a lot of time <SP2>
9186,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah yeah and um and also you're not there's no idea generation <SP1>
9187,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> you know <SP2>
9188,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> it's pure regurgitation at this point <SP1>
9189,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> right right right right <SP2>
9190,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> you know <SP1>
9191,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> although he expects like you to have thought about it a little bit <SP1>
9192,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> expand on your <SP2>
9193,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> eh mm <SP1>
9194,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9195,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> you know usually it's it's pretty much the same thing <SP1>
9196,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9197,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and then so you know once you write that essay um you uh you also have like the the side <SP1>
9198,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> two ids <SP2>
9199,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> like the id's <SP1>
9200,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9201,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9202,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> which are um straight up rote memorization <SP1>
9203,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9204,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and like at the end the final exam you'll have something called a short answer which is even more straight up rote memorization <SP1>
9205,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9206,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so it's like he literally wants you to just know as much detail as possible <SP1>
9207,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9208,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> the more you know the better <SP1>
9209,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> that's what he said <SP2>
9210,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah i'll go to the review session i think tonight <SP2>
9211,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> oh those help so much <SP1>
9212,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9213,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> literally you could <SP1>
9214,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> did you go to two or did you just go to one <SP2>
9215,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> no they're all the same <SP1>
9216,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9217,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so e even if you don't go he records them <SP1>
9218,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> okay that's what he said <SP2>
9219,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so just if you listen to them <SP1>
9220,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9221,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and because like what here my strategy is this right <SP1>
9222,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9223,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> very simple to save you the most amount of time you have like i think he says d did he tell you the philosophy with the id's <SP1>
9224,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah you have six he breaks it up into like six different <SP2>
9225,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> he breaks it up and he will give you one from each right <SP1>
9226,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9227,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so don't study all six <SP1>
9228,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> oh yeah yeah no <SP2>
9229,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> study like three yeah <SP1>
9230,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> i'm he said study three <SP2>
9231,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9232,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9233,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> exactly <SP2>
9234,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and so what you should do is like listen to the first part or if go attend the first part of like the route where he he will break he break has he broken it up already <SP1>
9235,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mm mm <SP2>
9236,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> no he'll do it in the review sessions <SP1>
9237,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9238,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so he breaks up everything just see how it's broken up and then depending how it's broken up you then figure out like <SP1>
9239,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> which three are the most interesting yeah <SP2>
9240,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> or whatever <SP2>
9241,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> or i mean i i did <SP1>
9242,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> easiest <SP2>
9243,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> y i did the ones with th the least categories <SP1>
9244,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9245,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> cause you know what he's gonna give you <SP1>
9246,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> ah yeah <SP2>
9247,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so that's how you play the game <SP1>
9248,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> ah that's smart that's smart <SP2>
9249,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> that's how you play the game <SP1>
9250,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9251,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> i i feel so bad about it on the inside but hey i just <SP1>
9252,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> but that's what he said <SP2>
9253,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9254,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> too <SP2>
9255,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> he literally explained all of that <SP2>
9256,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> just choose the <SP1>
9257,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9258,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> in class he was like <SP2>
9259,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah proctor that's sort of you're right he wants to make it easy <SP1>
9260,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> he's pretty transparent yeah <SP2>
9261,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> pretty uh he there he doesn't hide anything <SP1>
9262,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9263,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> like he literally is not out there to get you <SP1>
9264,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> right <SP2>
9265,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> if you you know if you <SP1>
9266,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah if you do the work <SP2>
9267,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> the only people who who pose an obstacle to that often are the ta's <SP1>
9268,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> then <SP2>
9269,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> cause the tas grade sometimes a little harshly <SP1>
9270,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> oh <SP2>
9271,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> like there've been situations where he's been like um oh you know this is a great essay he's literally told me in the rec uh has he sent you a recording yet <SP1>
9272,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> no i ha i haven't had ti i haven't gotten to send it early enough <SP2>
9273,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> are you in <SP1>
9274,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> okay <SP1>
9275,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> no issues <SP1>
9276,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> but like when i sent when i sent it even if you send it like the day of sometimes it's better cause it's like y you know <SP1>
9277,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> oh you can have him over override the <SP2>
9278,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9279,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> that that's that's happened four times <SP1>
9280,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> if he says it's <SP2>
9281,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah yeah <SP2>
9282,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> like <SP1>
9283,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and because it's and it's not th of course that's not the reason i do it or anything but it just happens <SP1>
9284,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> right <SP2>
9285,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> like for example he will in the recording he will literally say oh this is easily a check plus <SP1>
9286,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9287,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and then i'll get it back it'll be check plus over check and i'm like woah and then i show it to proctor and then there's been one essay where he made it a check double plus over check plus <SP1>
9288,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah yeah you told me about that one <SP2>
9289,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> you know the guy he's a great guy <SP1>
9290,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9291,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> um but yeah so with the id's like and that's why i was saying like you don't have to do all the reading <SP1>
9292,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9293,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> because the id's are really what you have to read for you know <SP1>
9294,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9295,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9296,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> the id's and the essays because if you're not gonna like the rest of it if you want to take it because it's an interesting course don't subject yourself to additional work take it because he like the most interesting part of the course to me was his lecture <SP1>
9297,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> is just listening to him <SP2>
9298,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah no totally <SP2>
9299,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> was his lecture yeah that was the real part of the course that sold me you know because like he is such a good lecturer <SP1>
9300,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9301,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> but the fact of the matter is like all the reading first of all is not it's too conceptual <SP1>
9302,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9303,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> it's not very detail oriented <SP1>
9304,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9305,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and the thing is like another issue with him that i had <SP1>
9306,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> the the ones i do like though are like the primary documents in the rogers or whatever like th those are <SP2>
9307,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> i barely read those <SP1>
9308,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> i should've i should've read them more <SP1>
9309,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> what <SP2>
9310,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> th they're kinda interes like we just read the industrial revolution ones <SP2>
9311,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> but <SP1>
9312,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9313,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> and it's like interviews of you know workers <SP2>
9314,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9315,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> who worked like whatever they wee like eighteen hour days <SP2>
9316,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> right <SP1>
9317,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9318,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> and <SP2>
9319,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> it's also but you also gotta keep in mind like the perspective like you and mishko are more like econ ir type people right <SP1>
9320,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah right right <SP2>
9321,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> now i'm a science guy <SP1>
9322,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9323,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so for me to like go in and it wasn't it's not as you know <SP1>
9324,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> oh yeah yeah it just <SP2>
9325,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> really i've loved grown up loving history but after coming to college i realized like there are degrees <SP1>
9326,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mm <SP2>
9327,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> there are real degrees to th there are people who enjoy these readings <SP1>
9328,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9329,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> i just you know for me listening to lecture watching videos like learning about the topics for fun is great <SP1>
9330,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9331,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> but like just the amount of dense reading for a topic y y you know it just it takes away the value for me <SP1>
9332,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9333,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah no i agree the secondary when it's like people talking about it i'd rather just listen to proctor <SP2>
9334,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9335,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah no honestly and i think you should do that with the the r the thing is that for some topics um especially the french revolution the he like palmer and cotin are specialists <SP1>
9336,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mm <SP2>
9337,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> in um the french revolution <SP1>
9338,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> so it's worth reading <SP2>
9339,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so it's worth reading that <SP1>
9340,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> although we didn't get cause we had the second edition of palmer so i didn't have any of his <SP2>
9341,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> oh so you didn't <SP1>
9342,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> i had like a brief gloss over eighteen fifteen or whatever <SP2>
9343,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> okay <SP1>
9344,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> and they like talked about a little of what happened before <SP2>
9345,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so did he did he did he not spend time much time on the enlightenment and the french revolution <SP1>
9346,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> no no he did but the reading just didn't cover that <SP2>
9347,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> i see <SP1>
9348,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> cause you know it was the textbook before <SP2>
9349,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9350,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so what do he make you read for that just rogers <SP1>
9351,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah a lot of ro and then there was a like a little bit of homer <SP2>
9352,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> a little blurb <SP1>
9353,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> and then and then he picked out some things from like winserster <SP2>
9354,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> okay <SP1>
9355,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> okay <SP1>
9356,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> and s just outside sources <SP2>
9357,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9358,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> that he brought in <SP2>
9359,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> makes that makes sense yeah cause he loves the french revolution <SP1>
9360,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9361,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and there's honestly a lot of reading especially with that and that's what made it harder but like honestly like some of those readings are much more interesting than um but for like topics i th i don't know how it is for the second edition but for like many of the topics like medieval europe unnecessary amount of you know like regurgitating <SP1>
9362,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9363,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> dense <SP2>
9364,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> y y yeah <SP2>
9365,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> the same thing <SP1>
9366,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah just dense you know like talking my medieval life and all that <SP1>
9367,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9368,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> like <SP1>
9369,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> he talked about like education women and all that and that was great but you know i like honestly the period i that i focused least on was medieval <SP1>
9370,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9371,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> you know cause uh keep in mind that for the first half of the course um b it's all byzantine empire <SP1>
9372,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9373,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> right so i like the first i would say even like up to the third exam i made sure to include at least one or two things about the byzantine empire the first exam is all byzantine empire <SP1>
9374,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9375,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> but like the second exam was about half and i made sure to like focus on the byzantine empire cause that that was just much more modular and and for that the textbook doesn't go into much detail <SP1>
9376,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9377,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so the really the reading's not worth it but like for many of the other european stuff they go into a lot of detail <SP1>
9378,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah yeah <SP2>
9379,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and you kinda just have to you know feel for w what's worth reading and what's not but honestly like you will see what i mean when like for the second exam don't go crazy as much with the readings <SP1>
9380,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9381,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> like <SP1>
9382,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> no i i'm already understand like i thought that when when he said id's at the beginning of the semester i just have like high school in mind <SP2>
9383,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> oh <SP1>
9384,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> where you you know you write like a paragraph but there's like fifteen id's <SP2>
9385,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9386,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> and you just have to know them <SP2>
9387,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> you know <SP2>
9388,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> right <SP1>
9389,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> but this is like before the exam you can just see exactly what you're supposed to study <SP2>
9390,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> you can exactly <SP1>
9391,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> and just study that <SP2>
9392,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> exactly yeah and literally you can isola you can bring it down to and many times the review session it gets even funnier cause he will give you like he will tell you oh you know this one i really really like this one <SP1>
9393,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9394,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah oh no i know i know i know <SP2>
9395,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> i really really like this one <SP1>
9396,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> this one <SP1>
9397,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> he he starred certain ones <SP2>
9398,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> this one is this one is ve <SP1>
9399,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> the crimean war <SP2>
9400,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9401,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9402,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> you should probably study that one <SP2>
9403,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9404,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah and then and then he's like this one will very likely show up on the exam <SP1>
9405,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9406,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> somes he's like this will definitely be on the exam so <SP1>
9407,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah yeah <SP2>
9408,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> you can know right then and there and if they fit in your category so much better you know like that is one of them gonna be there <SP1>
9409,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9410,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and here's another thing <SP1>
9411,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> and there's only two and he said that he was a softy like he said it would be two out of six but it's like two out of like ten or whatever <SP2>
9412,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah he ends up giving you like the final exam he was like oh you know i'll give you uh we'll we'll give you nine categories this time there were eighteen <SP1>
9413,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9414,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> cause he's just interested in everything so he just i don't know <SP2>
9415,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah he just wants to make it easy for you <SP1>
9416,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9417,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> that's the best part like he literally i didn't i didn't realize like i thought oh when i when i took his class i was like oh maybe all professors are like as but he's like a leaps and beyon leaps and bounds above everybody else <SP1>
9418,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9419,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> he just cause he like goes out of his way to make sure that you guys are taken care of the amount of extra credit he gives is just insane <SP1>
9420,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah that is preposterous i know movies if you write all the essays you get extra credit what <SP2>
9421,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> it's literally he's like saying like uh if you do what you're supposed to do in college you i'll give you extra credit <SP1>
9422,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah i know <SP2>
9423,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> if you do less than you're supposed to you will get full credit <SP1>
9424,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah you'll be fine yeah i know <SP2>
9425,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> i went and talked to him too about my essay length cause i've like y you're right i routinely write like six or seven pages for like a two page minimum prompt but he said yeah at the so what he he put it he said this he said that like at the end of the semester the number grade you have is the minimum grade you can have <SP2>
9426,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> it happens <SP1>
9427,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> and then he'll adjust it to where he sees you've put the effort in <SP2>
9428,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9429,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> which kind of makes sense so i guess it makes it worth it too <SP2>
9430,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9431,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> especially cause all of those essays just come right back on the exam <SP2>
9432,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> right but just if you if you just think about like even if you get all check pluses over checks in all your essays first will only count for very little <SP1>
9433,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah it's ten percent <SP2>
9434,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and then with the amount of extra credit you get like it's like i pretty sure some people had like a hundred and twelve average <SP1>
9435,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah yeah right <SP2>
9436,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so <SP1>
9437,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah no i'm not worried <SP2>
9438,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> it's an interesting class too <SP2>
9439,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> it's an interesting class <SP1>
9440,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> he loves it <SP2>
9441,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> i wanted to take the second half <SP1>
9442,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9443,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> but <SP1>
9444,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> i honestly <SP2>
9445,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> just the like the enlightenment and the french revolution industrial revolution like it's all very interesting and stuff but i just find it so much there's so much material so many people to learn so many people to think about <SP1>
9446,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> he's moved through it relatively quickly <SP2>
9447,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> it makes sense cause that was all the previous previous class <SP1>
9448,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9449,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> he he has to <SP1>
9450,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> because now you know probably indus the industrial revolution is probably new though <SP1>
9451,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9452,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9453,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9454,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and uh vienna <SP1>
9455,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9456,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> is new as well <SP1>
9457,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah we did that we did that pretty quickly but then industrial revolution we spent a while on and then yeah i i'm looking i wa i want like bismarck up through world war one <SP2>
9458,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> oh that's gonna be really interesting <SP1>
9459,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah that's my fav when we took that in high school that was my favorite <SP2>
9460,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9461,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> what are you <SP2>
9462,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> no i uh there's a hindu thing where you s if you step on something you're supposed to like touch it <SP1>
9463,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> oh gotcha gotcha <SP2>
9464,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so i stepped on a wire <SP1>
9465,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> oh <SP2>
9466,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> but anyway <SP1>
9467,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> i didn't realize there was a wire <SP1>
9468,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah no it kind of feels like one of us is in jail you know <SP2>
9469,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> oh yeah yeah yeah yeah <SP1>

9496,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> and then <SP2>
9497,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> got it okay <SP1>
9498,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> isn't that interesting <SP2>
9499,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah but i fu <SP1>
9500,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> and then people who sit right there <SP2>
9501,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> will have a ba <SP1>
9502,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> think it's equal <SP2>
9503,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9504,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> isn't that weird <SP2>
9505,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah it's an interesting design that they have it like the because it at this point there's no like you can't watch unless there's a camera like above or something you can't l really watch the conversations <SP1>
9506,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah the whole <SP2>
9507,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> but you can watch it from one end <SP1>
9508,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah right <SP2>
9509,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah it is interesting <SP2>
9510,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> mm <SP1>
9511,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> i don't know maybe that's part of it <SP2>
9512,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> it might be it might be i don't know it have you read blink by malcolm gladwell it's like thin slicing but he he there's like thin slicing is basically like the stuff you pick up on in the first like second of seeing something <SP2>
9513,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
9514,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
9515,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> so like i think he opens the book with there's like this um this statue that's supposedly this ancient like incredibly valuable statue and this museum buys it like they did tests on the rock to make sure it was the right kind of um material and everything and it's from some ancient civilization and then they bring in an expert and like ten experts come in and the first time they see it they're like it's fake and they're like uh it better not be fake we paid like twenty million and so they keep doing tests and they're like oh no it's real and then like ten years later they found out that it was actually a fake <SP2>
9516,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> but but like certain p like people just it talks about like the importance of like trusting your first instinct <SP2>
9517,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>

9519,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> wait i forget where i was going with this but <SP2>
9520,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> this is interesting though <SP1>
9521,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9522,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> a lot of it was like is it <SP1>

9667,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> agreed no it totally makes sense <SP1>
9668,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9669,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> i also got kinda i got stuck with that stupid calc thing for econ which is kind of a pain in the butt <SP2>
9670,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> what you mean <SP1>
9671,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> so i took calc one in high school right and then or or basically it was basically up through like midway thr calc two <SP2>
9672,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> cause we were doing like volume by rotation and u subs <SP2>
9673,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> okay <SP1>
9674,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9675,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> and all that <SP2>
9676,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> and then but it's not an ap class so i could have taken <SP2>
9677,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> oh no <SP1>
9678,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> i c so i could have taken the ap test <SP2>
9679,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9680,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> but it just wasn't you know we weren't like thinking <SP2>
9681,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> you didn't think about it okay <SP1>
9682,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> so i never took it <SP2>
9683,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9684,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> so i didn't get the credit so then <SP2>
9685,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> now you have to do it now <SP1>
9686,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah and i could like i know c enough calculus to take microecon <SP2>
9687,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9688,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> the in intermediate <SP2>
9689,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> oh but you need the class <SP1>
9690,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> but they won't let me cause it's a prerec <SP2>
9691,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> oh that's rough <SP1>
9692,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah it's so annoying <SP2>
9693,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> that's rough <SP1>
9694,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> so i went i'd like i talked to a calc professor here and he was like oh yeah just take calculus two <SP2>
9695,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9696,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> but then i talked to an econ professor and he was like like if you want the degree you need to have the credit it's kind of unfortunate so it set me back a semester or two cause now i can't take that but it's fine <SP2>
9697,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> i just doubled up on psych this semester <SP2>
9698,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9699,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah that's true <SP1>
9700,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> and got yeah <SP2>
9701,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> what are you majoring in psych and econ <SP1>
9702,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> quant econ <SP2>
9703,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> psych psych and quant econ <SP1>
9704,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9705,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> s quant econ is a lot of calc right <SP1>
9706,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> it's it's only calc one calc two and then linear algebra <SP2>
9707,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> okay <SP1>
9708,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> but and then it's a lot of instead of just like social science econ classes it's like econometrics and like stats <SP2>
9709,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> oh <SP1>
9710,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> that could be pretty cool <SP1>
9711,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> kinda based <SP2>
9712,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> like that's that is that more like finance <SP1>
9713,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yes <SP2>
9714,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> okay <SP1>
9715,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah well yeah a and just like the numbers behind econ more than just like <SP2>
9716,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> if we've introduced this policy it's gonna be you know <SP2>
9717,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9718,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> it's more micro econ like firmy kind of things <SP2>
9719,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> right <SP1>
9720,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> oh okay <SP1>
9721,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> which is <SP2>
9722,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> that's pretty cool <SP1>
9723,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah i like it more <SP2>
9724,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah there's a lot of that's niche area there's a lot of like s statistical predictions and thing <SP1>
9725,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9726,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> like there's a lot of jobs that involve doing that <SP1>
9727,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> exactly <SP2>
9728,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> you know stock analysis and um you know financial predictions <SP1>
9729,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9730,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and even you if you want to go into like straight up finance too that works <SP1>
9731,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9732,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> i don't know <SP2>
9733,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> consulting would help too <SP1>
9734,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> if you go if you you know <SP1>
9735,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9736,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> that's a it's a pretty solid degree like there's a lot you can do with that <SP1>
9737,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> cause it you need you need it in a lot of disciplines <SP1>
9738,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> well yeah y <SP2>
9739,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah yeah yeah <SP2>
9740,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> which which one econ <SP2>
9741,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> both of them i would say <SP1>
9742,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> or and psych <SP2>
9743,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> like the combination <SP1>
9744,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah i feel like they complement each other <SP2>
9745,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> they compliment yeah <SP1>
9746,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> pretty well <SP2>
9747,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> b especially like for ps you know like if you go into consulting the psych would help <SP1>
9748,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9749,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> i think <SP1>
9750,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9751,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> but <SP1>
9752,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah yeah no for sure understand how yeah but my friend who is pre med i think wants to do bio psych now <SP2>
9753,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> cool <SP1>
9754,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> w which i think for a doctor would make sense too <SP2>
9755,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> makes sense <SP1>
9756,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> sort of <SP2>
9757,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah i just i d i don't know how i feel but i want to because the thing is i want to keep like the option open of not going pre med <SP1>
9758,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> right <SP2>
9759,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> if i don't want to <SP1>
9760,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> right <SP2>
9761,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so i'm considering not you know like i that's why i didn't necessarily go the full bio psych route <SP1>
9762,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9763,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> cause then i would be locked in <SP1>
9764,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9765,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> i wanted to have like a viable second option <SP1>
9766,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9767,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so i've been thinking about biotech <SP1>
9768,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> no that makes sense too <SP2>
9769,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9770,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> there's a there's a second major called biotech here <SP1>
9771,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9772,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> where you can basically take courses in biotechnology if you like and um i think i might end up doing that <SP1>
9773,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9774,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> so <SP1>
9775,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9776,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> i thi yeah e even even if you were to go the pre med route i feel like just y all you ready need is psych and social psych you know what i mean <SP2>
9777,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> not even i think they say you need one social science <SP1>
9778,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah yeah no but i mean i mean just in terms of <SP2>
9779,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> in general <SP1>
9780,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> i think i think someone said they recommend it cause social psych cause it shows up on whatever that test the m <SP2>
9781,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
9782,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> the mcat <SP1>
9783,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mcat yeah <SP2>
9784,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> yeah i think regular psych will just show up too <SP1>
9785,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah i <SP2>
9786,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> and i think that um if i do take another psych class i was considering going like cbs if anything cause i might take like intro cbs now cause i've heard that's pretty interesting <SP1>
9787,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9788,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> like cognitive neuroscience is is interesting <SP1>
9789,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> i might take that class too <SP2>
9790,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
9791,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> to me <SP1>
9792,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
9793,2018-02-10-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,11,<SP1> you know um so i might end up taking like the cognitive neuroscience class or cbs but yeah <SP1>

10450,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> interesting <SP2>
10451,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so it's pretty cool <SP1>
10452,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> so you just like show up to school a few days earlier <SP2>
10453,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>

10455,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
10456,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> you have like four days of training where it's like <SP1>
10457,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> training <SP2>
10458,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah like um i don't really know how to describe it's just like a bunch of like talks with different like teams at tufts and like the oeo <SP1>
10459,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh <SP2>
10460,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> um <SP1>
10461,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> cause oeo is like training right <SP2>
10462,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10463,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh <SP2>
10464,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> um just so that you can be like a better resource for the kids so like if they ask you questions about classes that you haven't taken or like distribution requirements you kind of know how everything's broken up <SP1>
10465,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> nice <SP2>
10466,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
10467,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> and then it's like four days or five days with the kids um <SP1>
10468,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> what is like a fit what's like a typical day of fit like what would you do <SP2>
10469,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> like it's super busy like we try to keep it super busy because in the past a lot of the kids would like drink in their free time <SP1>
10470,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> i'm curious <SP2>
10471,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh really <SP2>
10472,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10473,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> wow <SP2>
10474,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so like the program tries to make it so that the kids are like always occupied and not like doing stuff that they don't want them to be doing <SP1>
10475,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> it's a good idea yeah <SP2>
10476,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> um so it's like you wake up you have breakfast and then usually there's like talks either from like tufts athletics or tufts deans or different um groups on campus kind of <SP1>
10477,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> nice <SP2>
10478,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> introducing them to all the different um options that they'll have like of things to get involved in <SP1>
10479,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> and then it's usually lunch and then some type of outdoor activity um and they have the option to either do yoga or swimming or like kick ball <SP1>
10480,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh yeah i always s i saw all the kids like carry like yoga mats <SP2>
10481,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10482,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> and stuff <SP2>
10483,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10484,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> all the time <SP2>
10485,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> exactly <SP1>
10486,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> and then at night um like each day something different but one night we like all go out into boston <SP1>
10487,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> i heard there was like a cruise <SP2>
10488,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> uh <SP1>
10489,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> right <SP2>
10490,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah the last day we have the fit cruise and we all go to like back bay in boston and they have like this big like cruise ship it's kind of just like a boat with a dance floor and like everyone just like hangs out um <SP1>
10491,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> and then another night we go bowling um and then another thing we did this year was we all um like in our groups had this scavenger hunt around campus and there were like all these different activities that had to do with different locations on campus so people kinda learned their way around <SP1>
10492,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> interesting <SP2>
10493,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> uh huh <SP2>
10494,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> um and like in the past we've always done that too <SP1>
10495,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh we h w i just remember they did that for go too <SP2>
10496,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10497,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> so you kinda <SP2>
10498,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> but the like peer leaders weren't involved <SP1>
10499,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so then they would kinda just watch and then it was kind of awkward for the freshmen <SP1>
10500,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> um but this year we were also involved so like me and my coleader like wanted our group to do really well so we were kind of a lot more competitive and then all the groups kind of got into a lot more cause like we were actually engaged in it too and wanted to win <SP1>
10501,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh <SP2>
10502,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so <SP1>
10503,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> nice <SP2>
10504,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> i thought it was good um <SP1>
10505,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> but yeah i think i'll p apply for next year too just to do it again might as well <SP1>
10506,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> that's cool <SP2>
10507,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> finish off <SP1>

10640,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> i could not imagine <SP1>
10641,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> but like you do that every you do that every day <SP2>
10642,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah i know <SP1>
10643,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> so like <SP2>
10644,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> but i feel like since i just go and i kind of steer the boat and like yell at them <SP1>
10645,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> i don't actually have to do physical activity <SP1>
10646,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> you don't work out or anything <SP2>
10647,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> like not during practice <SP1>
10648,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so like my role in the boat is i like sit in the back and i have like uh controls for the rudder cause like as they're rowing they can't see where they're going <SP1>
10649,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> and they have like no way to steer the boat <SP1>
10650,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> right yeah <SP2>
10651,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so like i make sure that we don't hit anything and like keep a good course on the river and then <SP1>
10652,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> you don't do like any of the when okay like in a typical practice would you be doing like different workouts er <SP2>
10653,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so like if we're off the water like if we're in the gym or something <SP1>
10654,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> then we'll have usually like an erg test <SP1>
10655,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> and then an <SP1>
10656,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> what's that <SP2>
10657,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> it's like do you know what an erg is like the rowing machine thing <SP1>
10658,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> that you <SP1>
10659,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh yeah yeah <SP2>
10660,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah yeah <SP1>
10661,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> is that the thing where you go <SP2>
10662,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah that <SP1>
10663,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> that thing <SP2>
10664,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> uh huh <SP1>
10665,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
10666,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah so when we have an erg test like we'll either have like a k or like a k it's like <SP1>
10667,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh yeah <SP2>
10668,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> if you did track and like were running a mile or something timed um so the coxens like all bring their laptops and then after they're done we have to go around and like record all information about like what their stroke rating was which is like how many strokes you take in a minute <SP1>
10669,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh wow <SP2>
10670,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> and like what their final time was and like what all our average splits were <SP1>
10671,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> so you do have to do that too <SP2>
10672,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> no so like for that we just like kind of motivate them as they're doing it and then like go around and take down their times <SP1>
10673,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh <SP2>
10674,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so like our coach he like thinks it's cool if the coxens do the workouts when we're off the water <SP1>
10675,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so like i usually do end up doing them just because like i ran in high school so i'm like fit enough to do them <SP1>
10676,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> um <SP1>
10677,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> but wait but it's like ho what does running have to do with that <SP2>
10678,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> well i'm just like aerobically fit <SP1>
10679,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> like i don't do well compared to them but it's just like my like view on it is that <SP1>
10680,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> m <SP1>
10681,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> like the rowers kind of need to trust the coxswain so if they see me like working out with them <SP1>
10682,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh <SP2>
10683,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> then it kind of like <SP1>
10684,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> okay it's more like a mental thing <SP2>
10685,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10686,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> i see <SP2>
10687,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> definitely <SP1>
10688,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah like i wouldn't get cut if i had like a bad erg time because the other coxens don't even do the workouts usually <SP1>
10689,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> ah <SP2>
10690,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> does that make sense <SP1>
10691,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> that m that's that's smart <SP2>
10692,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10693,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> i didn't think about it like that <SP2>
10694,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10695,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> that's cool <SP2>
10696,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> but usually we like have other responsibilities so we don't end up doing the work outs like especially when we're <SP1>
10697,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> are the coxwains usually the captains <SP2>
10698,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> no so coxens usually aren't captains because since we already have like such a big leadership role it wouldn't like make sense <SP1>
10699,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> ah that's fair <SP2>
10700,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> to make us captain <SP1>
10701,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> that's fair <SP2>
10702,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> but like i i don't think there's a rule that we can't be but <SP1>
10703,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> they try to like coxswains aren't they usually like you have to weigh light right <SP2>
10704,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah so the way it works is like in big races they'll have you weigh in and if you're below one twenty five like for men's coxswains at least um the weigh is one twenty five then you have to take sand with you in the boat until you are at one twenty five so it's just kind of a way to make it fair throughout the boat because if you have someone who's like ninety pounds then it's a huge advantage for that team so they try to like normalize it to a certain weight <SP1>
10705,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> um <SP1>
10706,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> wait so my question is like you try to weigh under one twenty five <SP2>
10707,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> no you want to be exactly at one twenty five <SP1>
10708,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> becaus <SP1>
10709,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> well i'm saying like you tr your try to weigh at one twenty five <SP2>
10710,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> right <SP1>
10711,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> wow psh <SP2>
10712,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> because if you're under then like you're gonna have to get to one twenty five anyways <SP1>
10713,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> that's crazy so like someone who is like six foot tall could never be a coxswain <SP2>
10714,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> and if it's like <SP1>
10715,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> right <SP1>
10716,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> like i'm really skinny but i'm like one let's say i'm like one fifty <SP2>
10717,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> like <SP1>
10718,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10719,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> like i would have to weigh down to one twenty five <SP2>
10720,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> right <SP1>
10721,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> which is why like i would never be able to be a coxswain <SP2>
10722,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10723,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> ah <SP2>
10724,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> no i don't think that like you like if you're one thirty or like one thirty five it usually doesn't matter but just cause it's like such a small difference but you definitely don't want to be like too heavy because it would definitely weight the boat down and like go a lot slower <SP1>
10725,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> nice <SP2>
10726,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> cause the boats themselves even though they're like sixty feet long they only weigh like two hundred pounds <SP1>
10727,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> ah <SP2>
10728,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> which is crazy they're like really thin carbon fiber <SP1>
10729,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh yeah wow <SP2>
10730,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
10731,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> so do the rowers also try to like weigh themselves down or not really <SP2>
10732,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> like not usually <SP1>
10733,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> cause they need muscle right <SP2>
10734,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> right because usually when you weigh more it's because you have more muscle it's like that outweighs the fact that you're weighing the boat down more cause you can like pull harder <SP1>
10735,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh <SP2>
10736,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> along the row <SP1>
10737,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> i see <SP2>
10738,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10739,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> so like as a coxswain do you like yell at people a lot <SP2>
10740,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah so basically the whole time that we're on the water which is like ninety minutes or two hours like we're the coach inside the boat because we can see like what everyone's doing <SP1>
10741,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> with like <SP1>
10742,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> do you stand up <SP2>
10743,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> no so you're sitting down um you have like your own seat kind of facing the rowers <SP1>
10744,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> are you in like an elevated position or not really <SP2>
10745,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> no you're like pretty much the same level as them <SP1>
10746,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> are you like always scanning people to see what they're doing <SP2>
10747,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10748,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> ah <SP2>
10749,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so basically like you face the direction that the boat's moving but all the rowers are facing you so like their backs are pointing to where you're going <SP1>
10750,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh cause they're like going this way <SP2>
10751,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10752,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> but they're actually going that way <SP2>
10753,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> exactly <SP1>
10754,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> ah <SP2>
10755,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10756,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so like when they pull their like blade is in the water and it pushes the boat backwards <SP1>
10757,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> okay <SP2>
10758,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> um or like forwards but backwards to them <SP1>
10759,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> is it like when the the oar right is it locked in to like a little thing <SP2>
10760,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10761,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> alright <SP2>
10762,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so that's called the oar lock <SP1>
10763,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> the oar lock <SP2>
10764,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so like the oar is like every time when we bring the boat down on to the dock they then the go get their oars <SP1>
10765,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> okay <SP2>
10766,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> and then they lock it <SP2>
10767,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> and then put them in <SP1>
10768,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> and it's just like kind of like they just put the oar in like you can move the oar in the oar lock it just kind of keeps it from like being moved to much <SP1>
10769,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> mm <SP2>
10770,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> um cause they still need to be able to like have it pivot when they go like up and back um on the slide <SP1>
10771,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> and what was i saying oh yeah so i kinda just like tell people to either like raise or lower their handle heights like fix their posture relax their shoulders like there's just so many different things that could make the boat like be offset <SP1>
10772,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh that's cool <SP2>
10773,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> like not balanced or um just like not rowing well <SP1>
10774,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so i'm kind of always like looking for things to pick on <SP1>
10775,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> interesting <SP2>
10776,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> um just to make them better <SP1>
10777,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> that sounds fun <SP2>
10778,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah like in races or when we're like racing against our other boats during practices like if we're doing like a two minute piece just for like kinda to like get the heart rate up and um be competitive with each other then you don't really say as much about form it's more like you get really intense and like start yelling all these motivational things to like work harder <SP1>
10779,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh wow <SP2>
10780,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> and then you like look at the other boats and call where you are relative to them cause they don't wanna look out of the boat <SP1>
10781,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> okay <SP2>
10782,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so <SP1>
10783,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> are there like a teams and b team and like a c team <SP2>
10784,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10785,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so the way it works is we have like a first varsity boat second varsity boat third varsity boat and they're all like eight people boats and then we have a novice boat <SP1>
10786,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> hm <SP2>
10787,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> um and the way that our program like arranges it is it's like one v two v have like the first and second priority <SP1>
10788,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
10789,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> but then our coach puts the novice boat like above the three v like he wants that to be faster <SP1>
10790,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> why <SP2>
10791,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> just because in races like it's kind of more prestigious to win in the novice event than the three p event just cause <SP1>
10792,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> so are the worst rowers in the three p <SP2>
10793,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> in the three v <SP1>
10794,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> in the three v <SP2>
10795,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah so he'll like if you're have novice eligibility which just means that it's your first year of college rowing then and you're like faster than people who are in the three v then he'll put you in the novice boat <SP1>
10796,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> but some people who are like faster than people in the novice boat can't be in it if it's like their second year or third year rowing um so like when i was a freshman i was in the novice boat and then after like two semesters i couldn't be in the novice boat anymore and then i like ended up moving up to the two v um and then like at the end of last semester i was in the one v <SP1>
10797,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> so you're like the top coxswain <SP2>
10798,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10799,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> damn that's so cool awesome <SP2>
10800,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> thanks yeah <SP1>
10801,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> that's that's dope <SP2>
10802,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah no it's pretty cool um <SP1>
10803,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> but like for the rowers sometimes what we'll do is have like seat races <SP1>
10804,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> if it's like <SP1>
10805,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> what do you mean by seat race <SP2>
10806,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> you like <SP1>
10807,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> like <SP1>
10808,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> like within the boat there are seat races <SP2>
10809,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> if you <SP1>
10810,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so if he wants to decide like who should be in the one v and who should be in the two v then what we'll do is like we'll race the one v and the two v like starting from like an even position like say we'll go for like five hundred meters or something <SP1>
10811,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> okay <SP2>
10812,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> and then we'll stop and then pull the boats together on the water and then like one person will move into the other boat and the other person will move into this boat <SP1>
10813,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh so it's like you're manipulating <SP2>
10814,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10815,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> like to see like <SP2>
10816,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so it's like you're just making one change <SP1>
10817,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> who is <SP2>
10818,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> so you're gonna see like who's making the difference <SP2>
10819,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10820,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> and who's not <SP2>
10821,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> and then you'll race again <SP1>
10822,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> and then if like this boat finished like if like the one v won the first time then the second time the one v won by less then like clearly making that switch <SP1>
10823,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh <SP2>
10824,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> so then that that person that person is like really good <SP2>
10825,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah the person in the two v like was better <SP1>
10826,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> that switch <SP2>
10827,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> ah <SP2>
10828,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> cause er was worse cause it made the boat go slower <SP1>
10829,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> so it's like very intense like if you get switched you're like okay <SP2>
10830,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10831,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> like i gotta <SP2>
10832,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10833,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> really bring <SP2>
10834,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> like my freshman year though it was kind of like within a few weeks everything was set and like my coach knew who was faster and who was slower <SP1>
10835,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> but then last semester like in the spring like the one v kept losing to the two v <SP1>
10836,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> oh wow <SP2>
10837,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah so then he would like do tons of seat races but then it would always be back and forth like it was kind of hard to tell <SP1>
10838,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> inconsistent <SP2>
10839,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so i was like in the two v the whole time that all this was happening and then this other coxswain was in the one v so then at the end of the season he ended up like switching the coxswains <SP1>
10840,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> like in the seat race thing <SP2>
10841,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> like not really in a seat race he just like for the like new england nationals he was like james you are gonna be in the one v and then the other coxswain was in the two v and like we ended up being faster than them so <SP1>
10842,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> so you stuck it <SP2>
10843,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> like i'm not saying it was me who made the difference <SP1>
10844,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> okay <SP2>
10845,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> but like i kind of did <SP1>
10846,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> um <SP1>
10847,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> that's g that's pretty cool <SP2>
10848,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10849,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> that's awesome <SP2>
10850,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> no it was awesome um like compared to the other boats like we ended up making it to the grand final and like nationals <SP1>
10851,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> are you guys d three <SP2>
10852,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> um so the way that men's rowing works is we're not really in the nc double a so we're not like a division <SP1>
10853,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> are you a club team <SP2>
10854,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> no so we're in the ira so we're like a varsity sport at tufts <SP1>
10855,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> ira <SP2>
10856,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> and we're like part of the nescac <SP1>
10857,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> mm <SP2>
10858,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> but most men's rowing programs like all the ivy leagues in mit and stanford and stuff are in the international rowing association <SP1>
10859,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> so you're in that too <SP2>
10860,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
10861,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> mm <SP2>
10862,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> so like the nc double a like since they govern nescac we have to abide by their rules and stuff but we don't like we could never go to like nc double as because we're not like a nc double a team <SP1>
10863,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> why not like can you become one <SP2>
10864,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> we could become one but there's just like no advantage to it for men's rowing because like all the people that we wanna race like all the good rowing programs on the men's side are in the ira <SP1>
10865,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> are in the ira <SP2>
10866,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP2> okay <SP2>
10867,2017-11-08-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,12,<SP1> yeah <SP1>

10999,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP1> i think <SP1>
11000,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP2> it really is <SP2>
11001,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP1> but it's it was fun you know <SP1>
11002,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
11003,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP1> i'm at west now so still still really close <SP1>
11004,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP2> oh <SP2>
11005,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP2> i don't even know where that is <SP2>
11006,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP1> west is like where the the elephant is <SP1>
11007,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP2> oh yeah right right right i do know that <SP2>
11008,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP1> yeah it's all right so how do you like miller <SP1>
11009,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP2> um it's perfectly like adequate you know like it does the job <SP2>

11019,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP1> but it's alright up hill is the best though never go down hill <SP1>
11020,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP2> i can't imagine <SP2>
11021,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP1> downhill is not good <SP1>
11022,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP2> you must be down there a lot though <SP2>
11023,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP2> isn't that <SP2>
11024,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP1> no i just have class at the school of engineering and that's it <SP1>
11025,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP2> it that's down hill no <SP2>
11026,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP1> yeah it's like at the like the steps <SP1>
11027,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP1> it has like the the memorial steps <SP1>

11113,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP2> it is early wow i didn't realize i mean you i feel like school of engineering you guys wake up at like eight everyday <SP2>
11114,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP1> no not really <SP1>
11115,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP2> when's your first class <SP2>
11116,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP1> um actually i have the ten thirty psych one which when i don't go i just wake up at twelve twelve's my next class so on average i wake up at twelve i guess <SP1>
11117,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP2> oh okay nevermind <SP2>
11118,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP1> yeah wait what time do you wake up <SP1>
11119,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP2> no i mean my i'm pretty lucky too my i always have like a ten thirty <SP2>
11120,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP2> but i don't why did i think that engineering always woke up really early <SP2>
11121,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP1> i don't know my sleep schedule right now is like pretty destroyed <SP1>
11122,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP1> cause i sleep at like three three thirty <SP1>
11123,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP1> and wake up at like twelve <SP1>
11124,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP2> mm <SP2>
11125,2017-10-31-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,13,<SP2> twelve <SP2>

11955,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> like <SP2>
11956,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> well why do we like <SP1>
11957,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> like what's the fucking point <SP2>
11958,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> like why do we <SP1>
11959,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> like adhere to these like societal norms like why are we nice to people why like was what's the point because we're just gonna <SP1>
11960,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> well that's my question we're we're just animals like what like why am i <SP2>
11961,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> like why do i feel the need to like what does it matter if i like am nice to somebody <SP1>
11962,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> exactly and like there's like i i don't i guess i don't real ly know <SP2>
11963,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> but i am like i have to be <SP1>
11964,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> what like a sociopath really is but like when you think a like a sociopath that's like <SP2>
11965,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> someone who like <SP2>
11966,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> just a normal thing like that shit you know like <SP1>
11967,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> it's just like someone someone who's like a sociopath just like <SP2>
11968,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> doesn't like have like empathy or whatever but like <SP2>
11969,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
11970,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> we don't like foster empathy completely ever like aren't we all little bit sociopathic like you can say like oh like i feel bad but like <SP2>
11971,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> it's like <SP2>
11972,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> yeah yeah we we're h we're here having a deep conversation about like the universe and fucking <SP2>
11973,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> sorry but um but whatevs <SP1>
11974,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> it's okay i'll get over it <SP2>
11975,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> you're gonna hear it blows nose mm nice <SP1>
11976,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> there we go oh shit <SP2>
11977,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> um <SP1>
11978,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> it's like the <SP1>
11979,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> something else i find interesting is like why do we <SP1>
11980,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> isn't it weird that when you're born you're immediately like in <SP1>
11981,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> like how you the government can just send you to prison like you never agreed to be part of the society does that make sense <SP1>
11982,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
11983,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> they like well <SP2>
11984,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> you're like forced to be in <SP1>
11985,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> there's this whole like idea of like the social contract and like the consent of the governed but literally like by being born for eighteen years you have like <SP2>
11986,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> no consent <SP2>
11987,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> there's no way to just live free like truly <SP1>
11988,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> but like would we want to is the thing <SP2>
11989,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> oh no <SP1>
11990,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> i don't t hink so but i just think it's f like <SP1>
11991,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> like <SP2>
11992,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> like it's crazy to think about <SP1>
11993,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> and it's really weird to think that there's like really not that much that separates us from <SP2>
11994,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> any other animal so why do we think we're so much like different <SP2>
11995,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> cause we got the brains <SP1>
11996,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> well but that's my thing like why do we think that everything animals do is just like animalistic and purely evolutionary but then everything we do is somehow different <SP2>
11997,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
11998,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> like i don't wanna say like everything in like psychology and shit can be explained by like the like evolutionary like <SP2>
11999,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
12000,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> but <SP1>
12001,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> view point but like <SP2>
12002,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> but yeah <SP1>
12003,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> kinda can <SP2>
12004,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
12005,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> e i don't know i'm just in intro to psych <SP2>
12006,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> what do i know <SP2>

12051,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> it's probably okay <SP1>
12052,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> buh <SP1>
12053,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> this equipment is so high tech <SP1>
12054,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> it really is like i feel like like like this is definitely much more legit than the one of the other ones i went to <SP2>
12055,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> what <SP1>
12056,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> it was so dumb <SP2>
12057,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> which one did you do <SP1>
12058,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> so i did this one <SP2>
12059,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> and basically so we had to watch a silent film <SP2>
12060,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> and then we had to listen to an audio that described the silent film but they weren't like exactly the same <SP2>
12061,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> then i had to play tetris for awhile which it was my first time ever playing tetris can you believe that <SP2>
12062,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> i played so much i played so much tetris growing up <SP1>
12063,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> i was nineteen and i had never played tetris <SP2>
12064,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> anyway and then i had to like answer questions but the questions could only be based on the audio <SP2>
12065,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> like if it was something that we knew i knew happened in the film like i wasn't sure if it happened in the audio too i just <SP2>
12066,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> had to say i didn't know <SP2>
12067,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> and the like after that we had to like answer questions about the differences between the film and the audio <SP2>
12068,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> and it took like an hour and a half and it was just like so stupid and then like i found out i was the control so like m that's why it was so stupid like and like the actual ones like they see how you do like under stress or whatever so like <SP2>
12069,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
12070,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> it's um like <SP2>
12071,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> like you you could do it like like one thing that they did was like they put your hand in ice water <SP2>
12072,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> oh <SP1>
12073,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> which <SP2>
12074,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> that would be kinda stressful to me i don't like that <SP2>
12075,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> yeah i'm i'm usually the control <SP1>
12076,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> like i've always like <SP1>
12077,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> i've only ever been the control <SP2>
12078,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> yeah i'm always like wow this is dumb and then i'm like oh it' s because normally they there's like a point to it <SP1>
12079,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> yeah this s th s a change <SP2>
12080,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> or some shit <SP2>
12081,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> i a <SP1>
12082,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> i did <SP1>
12083,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> but <SP2>
12084,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> one where like all of them up until now i've just been sitting in front of a computer <SP1>

12200,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> but yeah <SP2>
12201,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> is she like <SP1>
12202,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> not liberal or whatever <SP1>
12203,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> she's registered as a republican <SP2>
12204,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> but like socially <SP1>
12205,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> but like <SP2>
12206,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> so yeah she's like socially liberal but that's like kind of i kind of have a problem with people who are like just socially liberal cause like <SP2>
12207,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> in the us like nothing's going to change without money and like <SP2>
12208,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> a lot of the times <SP2>
12209,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> they play into each other like people of color are not just oppressed socially they're opressed like financially <SP2>
12210,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
12211,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> because of a lot of the social obstacles in place and so like for someone to be like <SP2>
12212,2018-10-20-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,14,<SP2> socially liberal but still like wicked fiscally conservative just kinda like shows like <SP2>

12923,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> she always gets me in the morning <SP2>
12924,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> oh my god i used to go to a pet store with a a girl i was friends with in like elementary school <SP1>
12925,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> we'd go every friday to this one pet store <SP1>
12926,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
12927,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> and we'd just like hang out in the bird room and just like try to get the birds to talk back to us that they're <SP1>
12928,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> that's so cute <SP2>
12929,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
12930,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> it was a very smelly room <SP1>
12931,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> yes birds sometimes get get really smelly yeah <SP2>
12932,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> yeah that girl actually had a lot of pets she had like a ferret she had she almost got a parrot for her birthday <SP1>
12933,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> oh wow <SP2>
12934,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> but that didn't end up happening she had like a bearded dragon <SP1>
12935,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> at one point th they had a lot of wild animals really <SP1>
12936,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> oh wow <SP2>
12937,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> at one point they had a fox like a little like this size fox that they rescued <SP1>
12938,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> fox <SP2>
12939,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
12940,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> um <SP1>
12941,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> but the fox apparently got jealous of the mom cause like it was very she was very attached to the dad and like one time you know the mom and dad were being like very huggy kissy and like the fox like clawed at her so they had to give it up cause it was you know being a little bit aggressive <SP1>
12942,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> well wait wait did she live in like a farm or something or was it just like <SP2>
12943,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> no like it was actually a very small apartment like they sh <SP1>
12944,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> oh wow <SP2>
12945,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> they should not have as many animals as they did and i don't think they were technically allowed to <SP1>
12946,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> interesting <SP2>
12947,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> yes i would not expect a fox to live in an apartment <SP2>
12948,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
12949,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> it was like one of those two family houses <SP1>
12950,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> oh wow <SP2>
12951,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> and they lived on like the bottom floor <SP1>
12952,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> so it was like <SP1>
12953,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> mm <SP2>
12954,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> maybe like three rooms or four rooms in the house <SP1>
12955,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> um <SP1>
12956,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> so yeah like every now and then they'd have to put a divider like just a fold up table <SP1>
12957,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> that split the kitchen and the rest of the house so like the ferret wouldn't get into the kitchen <SP1>
12958,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> oh <SP2>
12959,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> it got kinda good at climbing though <SP1>
12960,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> oh wow <SP2>
12961,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> which was the problem <SP1>
12962,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> yes i bet <SP2>
12963,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> and the fox wow <SP2>
12964,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> yeah that wasn't very long lived though <SP1>
12965,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> yes probably maybe that was a better idea <SP2>
12966,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> you know <SP2>
12967,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> probaby yeah probably it <SP1>
12968,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> it screamed it sounded like a dinosaur <SP1>
12969,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> oh wow well i haven't i've never heard an actual dinosaur sound but <SP2>
12970,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> but it was like i'm not gonna demonstrate the sound <SP1>
12971,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> it was just it just sounded like a screech <SP1>
12972,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> oh <SP2>
12973,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> but it was very soft it was a very soft fox <SP1>
12974,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
12975,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> alright <SP2>
12976,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> yeah no but my family like we didn't have any like any animals my entire family except my dad wants a dog though <SP1>
12977,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> we've been trying to convince him for ever <SP1>

12979,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> but he knows he's gonna be the one who like walks it at like three am when it's pouring rain in the middle of winter cause everyone else will be asleep and it'll like fall on him and we're like ugh yeah you're probably right <SP1>
12980,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
12981,2018-11-17-session-5_nogaps_step1_GPT,15,<SP1> also he's vaguely allergic <SP1>

13415,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> that's super cool <SP2>
13416,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> um <SP1>
13417,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah what about focus <SP1>
13418,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> focus it's like i w like major what we did we explored boston but we were doing community service um so my group was assigned the elderly theme which was interesting um we did a lot of different things one day we went to the i'm trying to remember the greater boston golden age chinese center <SP2>
13419,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oo <SP1>
13420,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> so it was this like senior center like a day center kind of thing um for specifically chinese um elderly people and so we went and they hardly spoke english so we were just kind of communicating through like gestures and smiles <SP2>
13421,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13422,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> but <SP2>
13423,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> we ran all these games as like a little carnival and like they were all competing for prizes and it was so cute <SP2>
13424,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> that's <SP1>
13425,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> because they were getting they were really old and they were getting so competitive about stupid little games just to get like the cookie or something <SP2>
13426,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> um which was really fun to see like like like childish side come out <SP2>
13427,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13428,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> um <SP2>
13429,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> we also went to nursing homes and like did like c routine cleanings that like we had a lot of different stuff but it's just a really nice way to start school i'm sure you had the same thing like just to meet people before classes start <SP2>
13430,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yes <SP1>
13431,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> cause it gets a little overwhelming <SP2>
13432,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i definitely recommend it <SP1>
13433,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13434,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i remember o week half of my friends were like i'm so excited for classes like let's start <SP1>
13435,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> and now they're like i want to go back to o week <SP1>
13436,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13437,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah it was so fun like it kinda felt like summer camp like <SP2>
13438,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yes it did <SP1>
13439,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> cause we did we stayed together at night so my group was ten people but we stayed with two other groups of like thirty of us every night we stayed together so we did like fun games <SP2>
13440,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13441,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and we like stayed up all night it was just like i it felt like summer camp i don't know how else to describe it <SP2>
13442,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13443,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and it's fun to have like the leader at least we're still really close with our leaders so we see them a lot <SP2>
13444,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> they're really nice <SP2>

13454,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> mm <SP1>
13455,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i'm glad i did it <SP2>
13456,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> that's good <SP1>

13463,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and then you get like rejected <SP2>
13464,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> like a bunch of my friends tried out for acapella and didn't make it <SP2>
13465,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> really <SP1>
13466,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> cause they make it sound like oh come join acapella there's so many groups but they're really competitive <SP2>

13474,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> crazy <SP2>
13475,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> and at the meeting they were like okay we're gonna limit it down to ten people and i was like oh what <SP1>
13476,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13477,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i was so surprised <SP1>
13478,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> that was <SP2>
13479,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i applied for dream which is um like youth mentoring <SP2>
13480,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> dream <SP1>
13481,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> so you go out um i think it's into somerville <SP2>
13482,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13483,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and it's like kids that go to the school and you like pick them up from school so it's a non academic it's not like tutoring or anything it's like just take the kids they um live in like low income housing low income family so they don't get to do a lot outside of school <SP2>

13485,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> so the goal is to like take them to the aquarium or take them just to do fun things like through tufts <SP2>
13486,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oh <SP1>

13499,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> it wasn't meant to be <SP1>
13500,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> no <SP2>
13501,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> is that you wanna try next semester <SP2>

13504,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i'm definitely gonna do that <SP1>
13505,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> well that's something is there like anything else you wanna join <SP2>
13506,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i was considering jumpstart but it's time consuming <SP1>
13507,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> next semester <SP2>
13508,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13509,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> for <SP1>
13510,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and yeah um im it was a blessing in disguise that i didn't get into dream cause i need my it's on friday afternoons and i really like to do stuff on friday afternoons <SP2>
13511,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oh <SP1>
13512,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> like bang out work or like do stuff with my friends <SP2>
13513,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> so it worked out <SP2>
13514,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> really <SP1>
13515,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah friday is my busiest day <SP1>
13516,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> really <SP2>
13517,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah i don't know how it ended up like that <SP1>
13518,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> that's so sad <SP2>
13519,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> like monday i have one class but friday i have four <SP1>
13520,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> oh no <SP2>
13521,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> and i'm like wow <SP1>
13522,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> friday i have one class in the morning so it's like my day to bang out work in the afternoon and then <SP2>
13523,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i don't know i don't really do much like friday nights but <SP2>
13524,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13525,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> just free that made my friday night which is nice <SP2>
13526,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> friday night's for sleeping for me you know i tell myself i'm gonna do work but after those classes i just <SP1>
13527,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13528,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13529,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> that's draining that's uh like tomorrow for me thursdays i have three classes but i have a lab six to nine so after that lab i'm done <SP2>
13530,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13531,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i'm so tired <SP2>
13532,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> wow <SP1>
13533,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13534,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> you have anyth do you have any idea what you want to do <SP1>
13535,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i'm thinking i wanna do i definitely want to do something bio related <SP2>
13536,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13537,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> so i'm thinking bio or biotech or both um cause biotech is a major that has to be paired with another major like you can't just major in bio tech <SP2>
13538,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> okay <SP1>
13539,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> so i would prolly do bio biotech because the like requirements would overlap so it's not gonna be as to be as demanding as if i did another major as my second major <SP2>
13540,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> what about you <SP2>
13541,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13542,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> um i still have no idea what to choose for a major <SP1>
13543,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13544,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> um i'm attempting to go on the pre med track so haven't started the requirements yet probably start next semester <SP1>
13545,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> <SP2>
13546,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> see how it goes <SP1>
13547,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah it's overwhelming cause everyone says that it's fine if you don't know what you want to do but then you like pick classes and you're like but what do i pick like i could pick totally wrong <SP2>
13548,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13549,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> like i'm running out of classes to pi <SP1>
13550,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah cause i don't know what then you also have to have like alternates in case they fill up by the time you get to register which is the worst that happened to me last last time <SP2>
13551,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13552,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> that happened to me last last time <SP2>
13553,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> that was me <SP1>
13554,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> all my classes were just closed and i had to rush <SP1>
13555,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13556,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> that was so stressful trying to figure it out <SP2>
13557,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> um cause the other thing is with crew i have practice till about eight every morning so having that like i'd prefer not to have eight thirty's i can't really do use there's usually a way around but eight am's or eight o five's whatever <SP2>
13558,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13559,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> the eight thirty's like i could make but it would just make it so stressful going straight from practice to class so i like that's the other thing is i have to try to make my schedule without eight thirty's <SP2>
13560,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13561,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> which i did this semester but i don't know if i can do that forever <SP2>
13562,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oh no i could not do that this semester cause the only classes available were like morning classes and i was like tired <SP1>
13563,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> that stinks everybody hates them so if you have a late sign up time um and s for me instead of picking the like early stuff i ended up picking the late stuff so that's why i have like six to nine lab and stuff <SP2>
13564,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> it's bad what classes are you in this semester <SP2>
13565,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> uh intro to psych calc one spanish and there is a seminar for first generation students <SP1>
13566,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> nice <SP2>
13567,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yes what about you <SP1>
13568,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> um i'm in psych one <SP2>
13569,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> oh my god how am i forgetting french three uh bio thirteen and then comp eleven <SP2>
13570,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> comp eleven <SP1>
13571,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> comp eleven is the worst <SP2>
13572,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oh <SP1>
13573,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i'm actually considering taking that <SP1>
13574,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> oh my god <SP2>
13575,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> just just to get experience in computer science <SP1>
13576,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> that's what i thought too cause i have never done anything <SP2>
13577,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13578,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> it's so hard like if you're willing to spend hours and hours on homework go for it <SP2>
13579,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oh my god <SP1>
13580,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> um definitely like talk to other people i know i'm like particularly struggling with it cause i have no programming experience but that's like a lot of people <SP2>
13581,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13582,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> um but like a lot of people have like math or math oriented brains are like really good at it <SP2>
13583,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oh <SP1>
13584,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> but i'm not an incredibly mathy person <SP2>
13585,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oo <SP1>
13586,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> um so just like it's doable its just very hard <SP2>
13587,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
13588,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> so i spend a lot of time at office hours and that like with my friends working on homework and it's just <SP2>
13589,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13590,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> it's ruled out the fact that i would study computer science so it's it's done one thing <SP2>
13591,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> but i figured that it's it's a good skill to have and i have learned a lot <SP2>
13592,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13593,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> um <SP2>
13594,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> but <SP2>
13595,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> really hard <SP2>
13596,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oof there's like half of my floor is computer science <SP1>
13597,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13598,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> so i see them like you know like gathering around the common rooms <SP1>
13599,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah just <SP2>
13600,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> in the middle of the night just typing away <SP1>
13601,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> no <SP2>
13602,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and that's what i hate is <SP2>
13603,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i feel like <SP2>
13604,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> there's no interaction that's what i don't like <SP1>
13605,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13606,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> no interaction and it also has like this weird culture with it that everyone just stays up late and does everything <SP2>
13607,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13608,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> like if you go to halligan there's people there like all hours of the day <SP2>
13609,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> no <SP1>
13610,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and like i need my sleep i can't stay up till one coding like that is not pleasant <SP2>
13611,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> so i don't know but sometimes you just can't avoid it but i definitely i'm gonna like i've been taking same with psych i've taken these classes to like see if i'd like them cause i never took them before <SP2>
13612,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13613,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and i'm not super interested in psych i really don't like computer science so <SP2>
13614,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> my experiments have like the result i guess is that i won't take these classes again but <SP2>
13615,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i think it's like it that's one good thing i guess <SP2>
13616,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13617,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> it makes me make some decision i guess i don't know <SP2>
13618,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> mm <SP1>
13619,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> what's your hardest class <SP2>
13620,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> intro to psych <SP1>
13621,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13622,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah but at the same time i love the material we're reading <SP1>
13623,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13624,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> it's just the amount of effort is demanding memorizing and there's a lot of memorization <SP1>
13625,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i agree <SP2>
13626,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> the terms <SP1>
13627,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> like the studying is not fun <SP2>
13628,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yes but i like i like the i like the material overall <SP1>
13629,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah i agree some of it's so interesting <SP2>
13630,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13631,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> o one of the things i thought was really cool was when we were talking about conditioning and like the behavior modification about phobias <SP2>
13632,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oh yes <SP1>
13633,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i thought that was so cool about how you can just like reverse someone's phobia that's so weird <SP2>
13634,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i i wish someone could do that for me <SP1>
13635,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> right <SP2>
13636,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> what are y what what are your phobias <SP2>
13637,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> spiders they're like the biggest phobia for me <SP1>
13638,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13639,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13640,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> what about you <SP1>
13641,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> that's that's fair <SP2>
13642,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i don't even know <SP2>
13643,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i'm always like honestly getting lost <SP2>
13644,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> so vague <SP2>
13645,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> whatever yeah i've never been really great un with like directions and stuff <SP2>
13646,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> um <SP2>
13647,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and i'm always afraid i'm like doing something wrong going someth like i'm afraid i'm just gonna like lose track of what day it is <SP2>
13648,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13649,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> like the other morning when the pow like the power went out um <SP2>
13650,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and since i'm in wilson it's like around the edge of campus we lost power most of the dorms didn't but we lost power so my alarm didn't go off so i slept through practice <SP2>
13651,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13652,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oh <SP1>
13653,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and then i woke up and i was like is it monday what time is it did i miss all my classes <SP2>
13654,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and it was so disoriented <SP2>
13655,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> um so that's definitely like i don't know i'm always afraid i'll just like lose track cause i also have a single <SP2>
13656,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> so i don't have a roommate keeping me like on track <SP2>
13657,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> ah <SP1>
13658,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> so <SP2>
13659,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13660,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> that was me this morning i woke up and i checked the time it was eight and i was like oh i have two hours until my first class if i did not check my calendar i proba i probably would have continued sleeping <SP1>
13661,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> same i forgot about this <SP2>
13662,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i hadn't i had it in my like i have a little agenda like planner i had it in there but not in my phone <SP2>
13663,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13664,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> so last night when i was like checking my phone calendar of what i had today i was like oh i can just sleep in it's fine <SP2>
13665,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> glad i remembered i had this <SP2>
13666,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yes so good <SP1>
13667,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13668,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i actually didn't know there was a tufts building down here <SP1>
13669,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> me neither <SP2>
13670,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i was lost <SP1>
13671,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> it said two hundred boston ave and i was like eh what <SP2>
13672,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> help <SP2>
13673,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah but it's alright i have another study today too <SP2>
13674,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oh me too <SP1>
13675,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> which one <SP2>
13676,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i i forgot the name i know it has fish in it <SP1>
13677,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> oh okay mine is like i think it's emperor goose <SP2>
13678,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> okay <SP1>
13679,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> um cause i realized how behind i am on my studies so i've been scheduling a lot <SP2>
13680,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah i have three point five so far <SP1>
13681,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> after today <SP1>
13682,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> ugh <SP2>
13683,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> good for you <SP2>
13684,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> after today i'll have <SP2>
13685,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> two <SP2>
13686,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> that's good that's good some people haven't started <SP1>
13687,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i need to catch up <SP2>
13688,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> at all <SP1>
13689,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13690,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah that's kind of m me because i was like oh i'll just do all that once like my season ends <SP2>
13691,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13692,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and then i was like oh shoot i have like not a ton like eh i have plenty of time like i can finish it but i was like i really need to get going on this so <SP2>
13693,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13694,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13695,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> what happens if you just don't do it <SP2>
13696,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i think the other option was like a seven or eight page essay <SP1>
13697,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> which sounds awful <SP2>
13698,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> it does <SP1>
13699,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and then if you just don't do those do you have do you like fail the class <SP2>
13700,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i really don't know <SP1>
13701,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> cause <SP2>
13702,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> cause they don't count toward our grades <SP1>
13703,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah cause the grade is just the exams and the paper so i think you do fail if you don't do any of this <SP2>
13704,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> ah <SP1>
13705,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i don't know <SP2>
13706,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i i'll just do it it's kind of fun <SP1>
13707,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13708,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> you know <SP1>
13709,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah some of them are interesting one i had was not uh i'm just like in front of a computer and just like clicking buttons which wasn't super fun <SP2>
13710,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> that was a lot of mine <SP1>
13711,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13712,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> this is the first interactive one i've had <SP1>
13713,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah which is better <SP2>
13714,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13715,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i wish we could participate in like the studies we've discussed in class <SP1>
13716,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13717,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> that's what i was expecting <SP1>
13718,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah some of them some of them are really interesting <SP2>
13719,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> ooh <SP1>
13720,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13721,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i like the little bobo the clown doll that was really funny <SP1>
13722,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> that was really funny <SP2>
13723,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13724,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i think just the fact it was named bobo too makes it like i don't know but the ones that we were talking about recently were interesting too like the harlow's monkeys and stuff <SP2>
13725,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13726,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> a lot of this stuff is just like our brains are so weird <SP2>
13727,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i don't know it just taking this class makes me think about everything more <SP2>
13728,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i just wonder like what would happen if we could unlock the rest of our brain <SP1>
13729,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13730,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> it would be wild <SP1>
13731,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> that's so funny i i just think it's so weird how <SP2>
13732,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> there's like environmental things that like physically change our brain like when they were talking about how exercise can like increase the size your hippocampus like that's crazy <SP2>
13733,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13734,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and in the book there was a study about um <SP2>
13735,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i think it was it might have been sixty or seventy year old people it was like elderly people <SP2>
13736,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13737,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> but when they exercise they had they had like a control group and then a group that exercised and the group that exercised like their cognitive decline like stopped like they s so the group that wasn't exercising their memory was just like failing <SP2>
13738,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13739,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> but when you exercise it just like keeps your brain awake which i think is super cool <SP2>
13740,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i've been trying to exercise <SP1>
13741,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13742,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> since i came to tufts <SP1>
13743,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> it's hard if i if i didn't have a team sport i would not <SP2>
13744,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13745,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> be working out <SP2>
13746,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> it's so hard <SP2>
13747,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oh <SP1>
13748,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oh yeah the gym the fact that it's so far <SP1>
13749,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> it's so far i know <SP2>
13750,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> and i'm just wondering when the snow comes you know it would be wonderful if they had like secret ungred underground tunnels that are like heated <SP1>
13751,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> which some schools do <SP2>
13752,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> really <SP1>
13753,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13754,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oh my goodness <SP1>
13755,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah my brother went to school at the university of rochester which is in upstate new york <SP2>
13756,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13757,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and so it's like snowy there a lot and they had it wasn't the whole campus but like under the main quads they had tunnels so you didn't have to go outside <SP2>
13758,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oh that sounds amazing <SP1>
13759,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13760,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah the tunnel's really kinda creepy looking but it like gets you from point a to point b without snow so it works <SP2>
13761,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah ah that would be awesome because i am not a fan of the cold <SP1>
13762,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13763,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> sometimes i wonder why did i choose tufts <SP1>
13764,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13765,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oh darn <SP1>
13766,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> did you like you obviously never had snow in california right <SP2>
13767,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> no <SP1>
13768,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> have you ever been in snow before <SP2>
13769,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> no i haven't seen snow <SP1>
13770,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> aw that's so exciting <SP2>
13771,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> unless in the movies <SP1>
13772,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> that's so exciting <SP2>
13773,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> <SP1>
13774,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> it's not as magical as the movies <SP2>
13775,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> no <SP1>
13776,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> it's nice like the first day is and then it's like falling and it's all pretty <SP2>
13777,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13778,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> but then it just gets like annoying and you're you like please melt already like i want spring <SP2>
13779,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13780,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah especially when it's like i don't know you have to like wear snow boots or like some sort of boots everywhere cause like wearing any other shoe just like doesn't work and it's just not fun <SP2>
13781,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> you heard about snow boots and i'm like ugh <SP1>
13782,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> these are so big <SP1>
13783,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13784,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah snow boots or like i have bean boots just some sort of boots because sneakers don't do super well in snow <SP2>
13785,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> ah <SP1>
13786,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13787,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i'm done <SP1>
13788,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and then when it it starts to like get all gross on the roads it turns like brown cause there's like dirt on the roads and that just ruins snow <SP2>
13789,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oh <SP1>
13790,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i'm excited if we have like a snow day like i love the first day it's all magical and pretty and especially if i'll have no class <SP2>
13791,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oh <SP1>
13792,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and we get us like an excuse to stay in your dorm all day <SP2>
13793,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i wonder how often like classes just get canceled because of snow <SP1>
13794,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> i feel like probably not often cause at least in my high school when it would get canceled it was because like the roads would be dangerous like to drive to school but here we can just walk in the snow <SP2>
13795,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> that's true <SP1>
13796,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> so unless it's like a blizzard i feel like we'd probably still have school <SP2>
13797,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> darn <SP1>
13798,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> even though we live on a hill i'm afraid of slipping <SP1>
13799,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> but <SP2>
13800,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> for real yeah <SP2>
13801,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> um apparently you know the memorial steps <SP2>
13802,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13803,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> apparently when they put those in they realized that when it snowed it created like basically this giant like ice slide of steps cause it would melt and go down the steps so it was just like this giant brick of ice and you couldn't really walk down the stairs <SP2>
13804,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13805,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> so that was they put in those stairs this was like four years ago or something they tore the stairs out and made new stairs with the heaters underneath so now the memorial steps won't get ruined because of snow <SP2>
13806,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> and it's just <SP2>
13807,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> it's just so funny like tufts you have heated stairs so you can <SP2>
13808,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> but no underground tunnels <SP1>
13809,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> that's so funny <SP2>
13810,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> they know snap <SP2>
13811,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> so close <SP1>
13812,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> we should like start a petition underground tunn <SP2>
13813,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> we should <SP1>
13814,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> that must i mean like i can't even imagine they'd have to like tear up so much to do the stuff <SP2>
13815,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> they would <SP1>
13816,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> it would be a lot <SP1>
13817,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> that'd be a lot but it would be nice cause i'm already like i grew up in this kind of climate but i'm still i'm cold when it's this weather <SP2>
13818,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> mm <SP1>
13819,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13820,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> i i did not you know when it got to the fifties i was like this is big jacket weather and everyone around me was laughing like no <SP1>
13821,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> yeah no <SP2>
13822,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> not yet <SP2>
13823,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> but i mean <SP2>
13824,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> my least favorite month is february because is just cold and gray <SP2>
13825,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> oh <SP1>

13829,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP2> cause for me in high school we had break in february so that was like nice thing to look forward to <SP2>
13830,2017-11-01-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,16,<SP1> yeah <SP1>

13963,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13964,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> mm <SP1>
13965,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> it's a lot like i didn't realize how much <SP2>
13966,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13967,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> i was like wow okay i'd i've been doing them like day like everyday <SP2>
13968,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13969,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> at this point like yesterday i had to do like <SP2>
13970,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> there's like six credits right <SP1>
13971,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13972,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yesterday i had to do like something with like chemistry or like i had to like memorize a bunch of mole molecules <SP2>
13973,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i feel like i saw that one on sona i didn't do it <SP1>
13974,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> but i feel like i saw it <SP1>
13975,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13976,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah i did one i actually like i'm in um i think it i can't tell if this is for stats in behavioral sciences or if it's for abnormal psych <SP1>
13977,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
13978,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i'm not even sure which one i'm getting credit for but a class needs this so i have four credits to do and i just like crammed them all these past like yesterday and today <SP1>
13979,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> that's what i'm trying to do <SP2>
13980,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> so like <SP1>
13981,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> cause i just like i feel like if i wait then everybody's gonna be trying to do it at one time and like there's not gonna be times that i want <SP2>
13982,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
13983,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah someone in my class was like oh it's smart to do it like kind of in the middle of the semester cause then either there's like tons of people doing it right at the beginning to finish it up or it's like tons of people at the end who are like panicking about not finishing it <SP1>
13984,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13985,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
13986,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13987,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
13988,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> this is i feel like i still feel so weird like to talk <SP1>
13989,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> cause it looks like a it looks like a mirror a little bit <SP1>
13990,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> it's definitely weird <SP2>
13991,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
13992,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> something about it feels like off putting <SP1>
13993,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> so this is weird <SP2>
13994,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah i like <SP1>
13995,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> this is fu i mean it's pretty funny i guess yesterday i did a s i don't know if it's like supposed to be confidential <SP1>
13996,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i'm not supposed to talk about the study that i did <SP1>
13997,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> but like they told me i was gonna talk to someone essentially and then at the end they were like oh turns out you don't actually meet the person they were just like we gave you info about them and then you have to like form an opinion <SP1>
13998,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> what <SP2>
13999,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> cause they asked me questions where like you're gonna meet someone and talk with him about politics and they like showed me a little bit about the person <SP1>
14000,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
14001,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> and they were like how willing do you think they'll be to talk about this and stuff like that and then i like answered and then they said psych there's no person coming like you're just like we just wanted to see like your bias and like racial bias and stuff <SP1>
14002,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> what <SP2>
14003,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
14004,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> so i don't know <SP1>
14005,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i was like <SP1>
14006,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> i just think it's funny that they have us like have us like have these things for credit it's like oh you're just like doing experiments on <SP2>
14007,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah i know it's a little bit weird right <SP1>
14008,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> it is weird <SP2>
14009,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14010,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> and <SP1>
14011,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i'm actually working um like i'm an intern at a psych like research program <SP1>
14012,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
14013,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i'm interning at mgh like their ocd and related disorders and basically i had to go through so much like training on like how to work in research <SP1>
14014,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> oh my god <SP2>
14015,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> and stuff and a big part of it was like ethical like recruitment and like they actually address it like the thing is with students giving them credit to do is kind of bad because like it ki like it technically could more like violate ethical like kind of things <SP1>
14016,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> but like they give you the option to do like a huge research paper <SP2>
14017,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> that's why it's not in ethical <SP1>
14018,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
14019,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> so it's like do you want to like do a huge research paper <SP2>
14020,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> but i st <SP1>
14021,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah exactly <SP1>
14022,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> or like do ho like hours of credit <SP2>
14023,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> where you don't really need to like it's like obviously i want to do the research <SP2>
14024,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah exactly they're like well they give the option to back out and i'm like it's not like preferential though <SP1>
14025,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> it's like it's not really an o <SP2>
14026,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> like they're not really weighing it well <SP1>
14027,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14028,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> i always thought that that like option was for the people that just like didn't do it in time so it's like oh now i have to write the research cause like <SP2>
14029,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah i guess <SP1>
14030,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> and i have my credits done but that makes more sense actually <SP2>
14031,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
14032,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i also yeah but i just like can't imagine anyone not wanting to do the like studies <SP1>
14033,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14034,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> like what like what aversion would you have to it that's so strong that you'd rather write the paper <SP1>
14035,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14036,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> maybe people would just be like oh i don't know <SP2>
14037,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> right <SP1>
14038,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> because you don't know what they're gonna do <SP2>
14039,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i guess yeah <SP1>
14040,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> like you don't know what it's about <SP2>
14041,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> but like some studies are so simple <SP1>
14042,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> but still <SP2>

14053,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> oh okay <SP1>
14054,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> barely even a paper <SP2>
14055,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> wait which ones are they <SP1>
14056,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> um one of our like what are they about <SP2>

14061,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
14062,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> hm <SP1>
14063,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> i think i haven't started it yet so i don't <SP2>
14064,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
14065,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> i can't tell you the <SP2>
14066,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i yeah just did the um the article one psych one's a really easy class i think <SP1>
14067,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah i think it's easy too it's just a lotta reading which i'm not used to <SP2>
14068,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
14069,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> are you a psych major <SP1>

14072,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14073,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> and i feel like i've heard a lot of bio psych <SP1>
14074,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> in the past few days <SP1>
14075,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
14076,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14077,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> what else are you academic interests i guess <SP1>
14078,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> um i'm i wanna be um md phd but like that's tentative on like if i enjoy school <SP2>
14079,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
14080,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> like <SP2>
14081,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah cause you have to spend ten years <SP1>
14082,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> i don't yeah <SP2>
14083,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> but yeah i did like a lotta um i do like a lotta research over the summers and stuff and i shadowed this um pediatric neurosurgeon and i like really liked him <SP2>
14084,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
14085,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> so that's really why i was thinking about like that cause i like would have like a mixture of research and clinical work so i think i'd like that <SP2>
14086,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
14087,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> no yeah <SP1>
14088,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14089,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> it's definitely true i was like i was at the um like psych psych society grad panel advising event <SP1>
14090,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
14091,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> and one of the professors was talking about like the benefits of like doing a phd versus a psyd and like he's like yeah a phd is the best because you do like a little bit of everything <SP1>
14092,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14093,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> he's talking specifically from a clinical point of view because he's a clinical psychologist so he's like oh in a phd you can do like research or you can work in a classroom or you can work with patients <SP1>
14094,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14095,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> whereas if you do a psyd it's like you're pretty much gonna work with patients like it's the way less research and stuff <SP1>
14096,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah i don't know what i wanna do with psych at all yet like techn i am i'm like i have a major <SP1>
14097,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> um clinical psych <SP1>
14098,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
14099,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> mm <SP2>
14100,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> and like it's fun so far but i lately i'm feeling like oh no like what if i want to like do other things in psych and i like can't explore that at all because the clinical psych requirements like there's a lot of them <SP1>
14101,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> oh yeah <SP2>
14102,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> that you have to get done <SP1>
14103,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14104,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah so i was looking at like fun psychology courses like psych of bilingualism and stuff <SP1>
14105,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah that's what worries me i met with my advisor the other day and she was like you're gonna have to take like <SP2>
14106,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> five classes and then an art class on top of it to get on track and i was like what i'm o like i'm a freshman why am i already having to take like five courses it was so crazy because like <SP2>
14107,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
14108,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> i didn't take calculus in high school so she was like y i have to take calculus cause i need like calculus and stats to get into the higher level psych courses <SP2>
14109,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> oh yeah <SP1>
14110,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> so like she was like you should just take them both at the same time and i'm like i'm not good at math i don't think i can take that <SP2>
14111,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i'm so bad at math too <SP1>
14112,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> i'm like yeah i'm not good at math i don't think i could take those two in like i think it that confuse me <SP2>
14113,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>

14128,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah no that's true yeah it's weird my advisor was like honestly very useless like i remember thinking last year like they don't really do much cause like i kinda showed up and i was like here are the courses i'm thinking of taking so i can do this and she was like yeah i mean it looks good like it all fits right go ahead <SP1>
14129,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> like they don't do much <SP1>

14135,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> if like i feel like i didn't want to do this cause like i don't know if they had this last year but they had that like advisers like your adviser could be like your professor and like you take a class with your adviser <SP2>
14136,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> oh yeah that's actually what i did and my professor was like <SP1>
14137,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> and i thought that that would be better cause like you could have an advisor that was like specializing in something that you're interested in <SP2>
14138,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah yeah it was really fun <SP1>
14139,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> do they don't have that anymore <SP1>
14140,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14141,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> i didn't no they have i just didn't do it cause i was like i don't think i want to like take a class without knowing if like that's going to get in the way of my other classes <SP2>
14142,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>

14147,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> no <SP1>
14148,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> i don't think i would've liked to have another class anyways so <SP2>
14149,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i get that <SP1>
14150,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah yeah yeah for me it was like my adviser was um it was i took classical myth that was the class i ended up with <SP1>
14151,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
14152,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> and my advisor was like classics professor and i actually i'm gonna i'm double majoring in classics and i think i ended up doing that mostly because of her in that class <SP1>
14153,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> mm <SP2>
14154,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> so like and now she's my actual advisor too so that worked out <SP1>
14155,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> that's nice <SP2>
14156,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah but like in psych i didn't really know anyone that well like it was so intimidating <SP1>
14157,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14158,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> cause i just did psych one last year and i was like i should get an advisor cause i'm gonna apply for study abroad and you sorta need one <SP1>
14159,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14160,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> cause like i have to declare and find someone <SP1>
14161,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> and like i don't know any professors like psych one i had three professors and it was a huge class and like they didn't know me <SP1>
14162,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
14163,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah it's ha yeah and then like even if you go to the office hours like <SP2>
14164,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
14165,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> the likelihood of them remembering all those kids are going to their office hours <SP2>
14166,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah i know also like i mean i didn't really have a lot of questions it wasn't like i could go and just be like hey <SP1>
14167,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah wasn't yeah <SP2>
14168,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> what's up <SP1>
14169,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> that's what i don't uh like <SP2>
14170,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> psych is like i feel like a lot of it is like oh yeah i knew that i just didn't know like that had a name <SP2>

14189,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> it's so weird <SP1>
14190,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14191,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i feel like i mean i'm sure there are students who go just to talk to those like very kiss ass students probably <SP1>
14192,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> but those are probably for like s yeah probably like smaller but no in bigger classes too cause there's always that one kid in the bigger class that'll like raise their hand and ask a question about like something that's not related to what you're doing <SP2>
14193,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
14194,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> what they just wanna ask a question <SP2>
14195,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah yeah <SP1>
14196,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> just to ask the question they probably do that but <SP2>
14197,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i'm in this one cla i'm in um history of ancient greece right now and like it's not super big <SP1>
14198,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
14199,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> it's probably like i don't know sixty people like it's big for tufts but just a generally small scho small kinda class and this one kid at the end of every lecture he'll like go to the professor at the front and like shake his hand and be like thank you have a like good day and i'm like what do you doing <SP1>
14200,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> ee it's like <SP2>
14201,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> like i get saying like bye thanks or whatever quickly but like <SP1>
14202,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14203,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i've seen him shake the professor's hand <SP1>
14204,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> but the but the thing is that's like probably hurting them anyways <SP2>
14205,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> what are you doing <SP1>
14206,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> because the professors probably like are you serious <SP2>
14207,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah i can't imagine it helps <SP1>
14208,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> like they're pe they're real people <SP2>
14209,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> right <SP1>
14210,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> they're real people like they know when you're being fake <SP2>
14211,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah that would bother me a lot i feel like in high school it was a benefit i don't know why but i feel like in college the teachers are more like normal <SP1>
14212,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah like <SP2>
14213,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> it'd be like what are you doing <SP1>

14219,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> that's so cool i've only been like i've so far for a while i was only gonna do a minor in greece <SP1>
14220,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> mm <SP2>

14222,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> mm i like latin i've been taking it for a pretty long time <SP2>
14223,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> oh yeah i took it in high school for like it was offered for two years and then my mom made me take it for like another year just with the teacher like on my own like after school <SP1>
14224,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> oh <SP2>
14225,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i just like sit in a room like him in his desk me at the desk in front and we'd just like do latin class <SP1>
14226,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> he was a funny man <SP1>
14227,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
14228,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> how many years of latin have you taken <SP1>
14229,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> um i've taken latin since the fifth grade it's only language i've ever taken <SP2>
14230,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> oh okay wow <SP1>
14231,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14232,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> so you're like fluent <SP1>
14233,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i guess <SP1>
14234,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah well as fluent as you can be in latin <SP2>
14235,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> can you speak it <SP1>
14236,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> but i can't like speak it <SP2>
14237,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> most people i kno like i could speak little things but like most people i know that like do latin they don't really speak it <SP2>
14238,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> okay <SP1>
14239,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> like they just use it to translate <SP2>
14240,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
14241,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> i can translate really well <SP2>
14242,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> like if you give me latin like i'll know what it says <SP2>
14243,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah yeah <SP1>
14244,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> oh i remember that being the homework like that was killer <SP1>
14245,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> but <SP2>
14246,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14247,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> just like a passage and be like just translate it <SP1>
14248,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> they don't really like focus on speaking <SP2>
14249,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> it sucked <SP1>
14250,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
14251,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> speaking it <SP2>
14252,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> my i think that one teacher like he kind of could like a l like not great latin but like he knew like basic conversational latin <SP1>
14253,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> like little yeah <SP2>
14254,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> and that was so scary cause like you never meet anyone who can like speak latin <SP1>
14255,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah thats yeah <SP2>
14256,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
14257,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> i j i don't know why though because like we make it seem like it's just something that you read i i ju yeah <SP2>
14258,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> i don't know why <SP2>
14259,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i mean it's a dead language right <SP1>
14260,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah but like you could still sp like speak it i've always wondered like why don't people teach in a way that like you speak instead of just like focusing solely on translating it <SP2>
14261,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i don't know actually like i just like i don't know if maybe because it's difficult like but <SP1>
14262,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah maybe <SP2>
14263,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> is any more difficult than like just another language <SP1>
14264,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> it's like it's probably like hard to do it in your head <SP2>
14265,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> like whenever i like try to jus like say something in latin i have to think a lot <SP2>
14266,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
14267,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> cause there's like the different cases and i have to make sure everything modifies each other when i'm saying it <SP2>
14268,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
14269,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> it doesn't like come out naturally like i could say it but it probably won't be like correct grammar but like someone who knows latin will probably know what i'm trying to say <SP2>
14270,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
14271,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah yeah it's basically yeah the conjugations are all so killer <SP1>
14272,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14273,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i also think why it's i mean maybe at least for like western cul like english speaking cultures is that like latins a different subject verb order <SP1>
14274,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
14275,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14276,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> so like that's also part of the reason it's hard but like <SP1>
14277,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i don't know maybe he spoke like mandarin i think mandarin has that no like i think russian is like that <SP1>
14278,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> i have no idea <SP2>
14279,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> it's like maybe he spoke russian he could speak latin <SP1>
14280,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14281,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> right i mean that be easy <SP1>
14282,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14283,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> maybe that's what it is i don't know <SP2>
14284,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> do you speak any other languages <SP1>
14285,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> mm mm <SP2>
14286,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> oh okay <SP1>
14287,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> cool <SP1>
14288,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> how you're liking tufts how's your first year <SP1>

14290,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> that's what i was scared about <SP2>
14291,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> oh which dorm are you in <SP1>
14292,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> i'm in richardson <SP2>

14375,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> in my life <SP2>
14376,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i don't know i was like i was like just seems like a part of like growing up in like the us and like north america just like you know you're gonna room with someone in college like it didn't really bother me <SP1>
14377,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> and like now it's not weird to me well like when i first moved in i was like it's so weird <SP2>
14378,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> that i will be like in my room and somebody that i like now i know them so it's not weird <SP2>
14379,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
14380,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> that's true <SP1>
14381,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> but like <SP2>
14382,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> its just like i don't know <SP2>
14383,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah i guess also maybe the reason i didn't find it that weird was cause i did summer programs <SP1>
14384,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> mm <SP2>
14385,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> in like um like some universities like when i was in high school so i had a roommate and like a college dorm for a little bit <SP1>

14387,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> no it was fine but yeah i guess it is weird <SP1>
14388,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> i guess like especially like what you're saying about the whole like american culture thing like summer camp and stuff like <SP2>
14389,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
14390,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> but i never did summer camp so i <SP2>

14396,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
14397,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> cause we didn't really live in that big of a house and i sh me and her shared a room <SP2>
14398,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> mhm <SP1>

14401,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
14402,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> it's not the sharing the space thing that bothered me <SP2>
14403,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> it just the fact that you didn't know s the person <SP1>
14404,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14405,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> yeah i guess that makes sense yeah i was so li i'm an only child and i loved moving into a dorm i was so happy to like have someone constantly around and like there's always people in the hallway you can like stop like pop in and say hi <SP1>
14406,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> that's funny <SP2>
14407,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> like people hang in the common room like it was a great time for me i was thriving last year i mean i still am this year cause i live in a house with ten people so like there's usually like someone around <SP1>

14640,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah it's just <SP2>
14641,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
14642,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> i don't know <SP2>
14643,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> also like similarly i saw silence of the lambs last night because it was like i've always wanted <SP1>

14650,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> and it was well done like all that but i wasn't like scared <SP1>
14651,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> i think it's j honestly i think it's though cause like i watched a lot of criminal minds last year and i still do <SP1>
14652,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> hm <SP2>
14653,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> and i it kinda had the same vibe like it was the same level of like oh this is so dark he's like skinning these women to make a dress that i was like that's cool like i've seen that like i mean <SP1>
14654,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> i've seen that it's not like <SP2>
14655,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> it be like that sometimes it be like that right <SP1>
14656,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP1> just did not scare me <SP1>
14657,2017-11-01-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,17,<SP2> yeah <SP2>

14942,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> but damn you should try for the next test just like maybe maybe one hour <SP2>
14943,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i mean <SP1>
14944,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> not even <SP2>
14945,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i it's a little too late at this point <SP1>
14946,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> just like go <SP2>
14947,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> like i already i have like a like a b minus i think <SP1>
14948,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> wait is <SP2>
14949,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> something like that <SP1>
14950,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> it's not bad <SP2>
14951,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> no but like it i'm better off taking it pass or fail cause that doesn't contribute to my gpa <SP1>
14952,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> that's true <SP2>
14953,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> so like i'm i might as well so then all i need to keep it above is a seventy <SP1>
14954,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> mkay <SP2>
14955,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> i mean you could still try honestly <SP2>
14956,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i'll try a little bit <SP1>

14958,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i'll give you like fifteen minutes <SP1>
14959,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> okay fift yeah that'll work <SP2>
14960,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i'll give you i'll give you uh <SP1>
14961,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> honestly <SP2>
14962,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> so before before thursday's or whenever we have the cla i have class tuesday and thursday's <SP1>
14963,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14964,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> um every morning at eight thirty i have calc until nine <SP1>
14965,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> mm wait how's calc going by the way <SP2>
14966,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> twenty <SP1>
14967,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> uh i mean it's fine <SP1>
14968,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> is it calc one <SP2>
14969,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> no calc three <SP1>
14970,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> er <SP2>
14971,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> three mm kay <SP2>
14972,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah so after that i have breakfast and i'll i'll look at my notes during breakfast <SP1>
14973,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> oh okay <SP2>
14974,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> okay <SP1>
14975,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
14976,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> that that is what i did for the last one <SP1>
14977,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> solid <SP2>
14978,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i was just like good good good good that was it <SP1>
14979,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> but yeah calc calc is like it's good the first test was brutal <SP1>
14980,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> n <SP2>
14981,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> for like everybody <SP1>
14982,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> really <SP2>
14983,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> um i think the average was like a like a sixty nine or something like that <SP1>
14984,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> damn <SP2>
14985,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> but yeah <SP1>
14986,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i d i did i did well on that one <SP1>
14987,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> ah <SP2>
14988,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> which made me feel good <SP1>
14989,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> oh my god <SP2>
14990,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah i like math <SP1>
14991,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> oh uh yeah <SP2>
14992,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> uh uh <SP1>
14993,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i'm good at math <SP1>
14994,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> um was your school like really did it like do you feel prepared coming from your s high school <SP2>
14995,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i mean this semester is kind of a joke for me so far like i i'm not like i don't have work at all i have like a half an hour of work like a week it's kind of absurd alright maybe more than that i have like three hours of work a week so like <SP1>
14996,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> your school did prepare you cause that's not normal <SP2>
14997,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> apparently <SP1>
14998,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> yeah that's not normal <SP2>
14999,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> no i think just the classes that i'm taking are so easy <SP1>
15000,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> calc th calc three <SP2>
15001,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> ps psych is doable honestly <SP2>
15002,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
15003,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> well psych i don't even read <SP1>
15004,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i don't even like read the textbook so i don't do anything for cl <SP1>
15005,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> okay <SP2>
15006,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> oh i don't r like when the test like w the the test was on when did we take the test <SP2>
15007,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> um tuesday thurs <SP2>
15008,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i don't remember <SP1>
15009,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> i don't know <SP2>
15010,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i it was a tuesday and it was the tuesday after my monday calc exam <SP1>
15011,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> and i was <SP2>
15012,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> ugh so yeah i i had the chem test on the same day <SP2>
15013,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> like i've had chem and psych <SP2>
15014,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> oo <SP1>
15015,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> my first two exams both of them were on the same day <SP2>
15016,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> so i was like freaking out going like chem psych chem psych i didn't like study well <SP2>
15017,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> damn <SP1>
15018,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> inter leaving practice <SP1>
15019,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> yeah oh such a great practice um no <SP2>
15020,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> but um what was i saying <SP2>
15021,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> what was i saying what was my point <SP2>
15022,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> ex exam something about the exam <SP1>
15023,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> whatever the thing is oh that it's not normal that your your workload is cause you're taking calc three psych <SP2>
15024,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> oh yeah <SP1>
15025,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
15026,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> um what's the other class you're taking <SP2>
15027,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> english <SP1>
15028,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> english <SP2>
15029,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> and robotics <SP1>
15030,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> and robotics <SP2>
15031,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> robotics i probably have the most work <SP1>
15032,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> really <SP2>
15033,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> but it's like hands on like i'm building lego stuff <SP1>
15034,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> okay <SP2>
15035,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> and that's about it <SP1>
15036,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> that's <SP2>
15037,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
15038,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> so my high school was trash <SP2>
15039,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> oh really <SP1>
15040,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> like everyone had straight a's everyone had a four point something gpa <SP2>
15041,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> it was <SP2>
15042,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
15043,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> that's brutal <SP1>
15044,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> so i'm here like oh my god <SP2>
15045,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
15046,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> what is all this work <SP2>
15047,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i mean i mean i seriously do think that my my schedule's way too easy <SP1>
15048,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i should've taken five classes like a hundred percent and i should've taken a lab class <SP1>
15049,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> mm <SP2>
15050,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> cause then i would've actually had work <SP1>
15051,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> but like i don't <SP1>
15052,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> so you wanna take you wanna have more work <SP2>
15053,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> well because be so i can take less work later on <SP1>
15054,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> that's true <SP2>
15055,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> cause i'm tryna double major <SP1>
15056,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> oh <SP2>
15057,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah with chemical engineering which is ridiculous to begin with <SP1>
15058,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> that's <SP2>
15059,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i might do like astrophysics is what i'm tryna to do <SP1>
15060,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> dude <SP2>
15061,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> stop <SP2>
15062,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i'm serious though <SP1>
15063,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> what <SP2>
15064,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah my i started making my schedule for next semester and i'm gonna have like five classes on thursdays <SP1>
15065,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> what are you planning on on five classes on one day <SP2>
15066,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah and then four four on tuesdays <SP1>
15067,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> how is that even possible <SP2>
15068,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> cause i go from like one o'clock till like seven <SP1>
15069,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> oh my god <SP2>
15070,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> straight <SP1>
15071,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
15072,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> it's brutal <SP1>
15073,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> are you sure you want to do that <SP2>
15074,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i r i don't really have a choice like i <SP1>
15075,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> i th i heard the like the engineering like schedule is like really <SP2>
15076,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> it's stupid <SP1>
15077,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> r right <SP2>
15078,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> cause you don't have any flexibility <SP1>
15079,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
15080,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> we get like <SP1>
15081,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> two free credits all four years and if you have ap credits you get more <SP1>
15082,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> that's craz <SP2>
15083,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> which i do but i'm using those ap credits for double majoring so like <SP1>
15084,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> that's crazy man <SP2>
15085,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah i'm tryna take uh electronics which is like physics like forty one <SP1>
15086,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> kay <SP2>
15087,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> it's just some physics class that contributes <SP1>
15088,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> and i'm here like struggling with chem one and you're taking all these all these all these t wow <SP2>
15089,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> okay keep going i'm sorry <SP2>
15090,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah and then so that goes towards any physics major that i want or minor i think and then i'm gonna take uh general genetics for bio <SP1>
15091,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> that sounds cool <SP2>
15092,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i think it's in the forties for bio um and that'll fulfill a foundation elective for chemical engineering <SP1>
15093,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> uh and it doesn't have a lab which is great and then i'll be in <SP1>
15094,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> didn't you want a lab though <SP2>
15095,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> well but that one i don't have to take a lab <SP1>
15096,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> hm mm <SP2>
15097,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> cause like i could i sure i could take bio fourteen instead but that has a lab so i might as well take the one with less effort <SP1>
15098,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> people say that bio fourteen is like pretty doable <SP2>
15099,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
15100,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> but <SP2>
15101,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> but genetics is probably easier <SP1>
15102,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> okay okay <SP2>
15103,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> also bio fourteen wouldn't even fit in my schedule so <SP1>
15104,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> and yeah <SP2>
15105,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i can't do that <SP1>
15106,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> ps the lab and everything <SP2>
15107,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
15108,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> and then es two which is coding in matlab <SP1>
15109,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> it's an engineering thing <SP1>
15110,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> uh i don't know what to think about that class we'll see um cause i'm not a big coder so <SP1>
15111,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> i mean that's fine <SP2>
15112,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
15113,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> and then i'll be in diff eq <SP1>
15114,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> uh cause i need that for chemical engineering and that also goes towards any physics major as well <SP1>
15115,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> and i'll be in linear algebra cause that goes towards physics majors <SP1>
15116,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> crazy <SP2>
15117,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yep <SP1>
15118,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> so yeah i'm just thinking of like i wanna get done with chem <SP2>
15119,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> get that over with i i am not a fan of chem <SP2>

15178,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> like like everything that's happened <SP1>
15179,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
15180,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> like they used to be like like they had like a huge golden age of like science and stuff <SP1>
15181,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> no <SP2>
15182,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> and then like now it's not very much like that <SP1>
15183,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> no yeah <SP2>
15184,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> so exactly i wanna like kinda understand some of it <SP2>
15185,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah <SP1>

15189,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
15190,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> kind of <SP2>
15191,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> kinda need psych <SP1>
15192,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> um so i'm thinking of taking abnormal psych <SP2>
15193,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> but the only thing like that's kinda bothering me with that it's the like schedule a time schedule cause it only meets once a week <SP2>
15194,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
15195,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> oh really <SP1>
15196,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> and it's on thursdays from six thirty to nine <SP2>
15197,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> oo my my uh lab for electronics is on mondays from six thirty to nine <SP1>
15198,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> mm but that's different it's on on a monday <SP2>
15199,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> like <SP2>
15200,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> oh thursday yeah <SP1>
15201,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> thursday <SP2>
15202,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i mean i mean do you have classes on friday <SP1>
15203,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> i don't think like if my schedule works out i wouldn't have any classes on friday <SP2>
15204,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i i don't have a choice <SP1>
15205,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> but at least they don't start till like ten thirty which isn't bad <SP1>
15206,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> all every single day i start at ten thirty <SP1>
15207,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> no this semester is so bad i every day um it's i have chem at eight thirty <SP2>
15208,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> same i have chem at or i have calc at eight thirty tuesday thurday friday which is brutal <SP1>
15209,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> and the past two the past two thursday nights i've gone out and like it it has not been a good idea <SP1>
15210,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> it's so bad <SP2>
15211,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> it's not like <SP2>
15212,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> see no and that's exactly like <SP2>
15213,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> like thursday nine o'clock everybody's gonna be like getting ready and i'm just gonna be stuck in psych <SP2>
15214,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yep <SP1>
15215,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> but they told me it's like a really cool class <SP2>
15216,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
15217,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> so i'm like thinking about that one but maybe <SP2>
15218,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> that's a long lecture <SP1>
15219,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> i c <SP2>
15220,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> i know <SP2>
15221,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> a two and a half hour lecture jeez <SP1>
15222,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
15223,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> damn <SP1>
15224,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> so not a fan of it but basically it's it's pretty interesting so maybe that or e like social psych or developmental psych <SP2>
15225,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> i mean do you have to take abnormal psych at some point or no <SP1>
15226,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> um i yeah like it's like one of the they say like oh from these classes pick two like from this section pick two classes <SP2>
15227,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> oh okay yeah yeah <SP1>
15228,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> and from this section pick other two <SP2>
15229,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> so and then that one fits like under uh like category for the biopsych but i can ta honestly i can take any other class and i think it'll work <SP2>
15230,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah you could just take it some other semester and hope that the lecture lands somewhere else <SP1>
15231,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
15232,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> yeah cause i met with um my major well it's like i'm in the pre med society thing <SP2>
15233,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> okay <SP1>
15234,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> where i just signed up i'm like oh let's see how this goes <SP2>
15235,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> just why not <SP1>
15236,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> um so i signed up for that and my mentor she we had a a thing yesterday like for everyone <SP2>
15237,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
15238,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> and my mentor didn't show up so i got yeah yeah <SP2>
15239,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> wow that's cool <SP1>
15240,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> aw awesome yeah so i got paired up with this other um girl and um she said that i should keep abnormal psych on my list but it usually like fills up so like <SP2>
15241,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> pick something else as well <SP1>
15242,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
15243,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
15244,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> that's the problem with mine like if something fills up and i don't get into it i have no idea what the hell i'll do <SP1>
15245,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> like there's like two different ways that my schedule can go and that's it <SP1>
15246,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> if i just like sw switch these two classes to different um places <SP1>
15247,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> and that's that's all i got <SP1>
15248,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> so i kinda need to get in all my classes <SP1>
15249,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> like co did you check your registration time <SP2>

15251,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> oo okay <SP2>
15252,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> so i have to beat the other engineers or all freshmen engineers i think the upper classmen go before us <SP1>
15253,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> yeah upper classmen have like the <SP2>
15254,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> and like genetics and and uh and electronics are probably mostly upper classmen classes <SP1>
15255,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> so i don't know if i'm gonna get in those <SP1>
15256,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> ugh <SP2>
15257,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
15258,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> um and if i don't i just have to pick another hass elective and just do that even though i'm wasting time cause i kinda want those later on too <SP1>
15259,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> yeah for like a more kinda chill <SP2>

15295,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> we got to like derivatives and like <SP2>
15296,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> you're finally like touching calculus <SP1>
15297,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP2> and like the whole second semester we didn't have anyone teaching us <SP2>
15298,2017-11-07-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,18,<SP1> damn <SP1>

15609,2018-10-02-session-4-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,19,<SP1> that's what that's what they told me that makes sense because if they it's always a holiday's always on monday <SP1>
15610,2018-10-02-session-4-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,19,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
15611,2018-10-02-session-4-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,19,<SP1> so like if they always did every monday <SP1>
15612,2018-10-02-session-4-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,19,<SP2> so they wanna give us yeah <SP2>
15613,2018-10-02-session-4-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,19,<SP1> they switch it off every other time they do like push it to tuesday o r just leave it <SP1>

16220,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> and i had to mediate more than play <SP2>
16221,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> for like <SP1>
16222,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> is this is this like correctly i don't know <SP1>
16223,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> it's just like yeah <SP2>

16295,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> oh so it's here <SP2>
16296,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> it's here <SP1>
16297,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> oh <SP2>
16298,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> so i could drive it theoretically but like i just don't <SP1>
16299,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
16300,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> we could've napped that would have ruined the study <SP1>
16301,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> yeah that would've been <SP2>
16302,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> i don't think we would have gotten credit <SP1>
16303,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> i think we've but they would have just been like this is great guys <SP2>
16304,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> they've have been like <SP1>
16305,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> the would've been like <SP1>
16306,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> like turn off the lights just like <SP1>
16307,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> we'd prefer to we'd prefer to to participate in a sleep study <SP1>
16308,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> you can you can measure my wave if you want <SP1>
16309,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> look at my alpha <SP2>
16310,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> my alpha beta data i'm being <SP1>
16311,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> and delta <SP2>
16312,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> data delta <SP1>
16313,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> data <SP1>
16314,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> beta <SP2>
16315,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> beta <SP1>
16316,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> just just catch them all up on everything <SP2>
16317,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> yikes <SP1>
16318,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> yeah i'd be like alright so here's the tea so here's the tea <SP1>
16319,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> all right so here's the <SP2>
16320,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> oh my god that'd be so funny they'd be like yikes we did not need this information <SP1>
16321,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> they'd be like no no no no <SP2>
16322,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> you think we are doing for information we doesn't does not apply and outlier in the study <SP1>
16323,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> just expose like <SP2>
16324,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> everyone <SP1>
16325,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> j james lowa like everything everyone's done for the last couple months <SP2>
16326,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
16327,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> like alright so it all started when we got here <SP1>
16328,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> so it all started night one when we all went to lax house um <SP2>
16329,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> this is how we could tell the world <SP2>
16330,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> oh my god <SP1>
16331,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> we could tell the world <SP1>
16332,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> i know <SP2>
16333,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> expose everyone and everything <SP1>
16334,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> i feel like that's abusing the study <SP2>
16335,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> probably <SP1>
16336,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP1> that coffee did not do anything for me i'm still so tired <SP1>
16337,2018-10-23-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,20,<SP2> no me too <SP2>

16626,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> <SP2>
16627,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> i don't know anything all these people they're like talking about like neurons and like nicotine receptors and i'm just like sitting there like <SP2>
16628,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> hm interesting <SP2>
16629,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> you're like didn't do the psych reading yet <SP1>
16630,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> oh i d <SP2>
16631,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> don't spoil it <SP1>
16632,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> can you sh i don't know it yet oh the psych reading was like actually relevant to what they're talking about which is cool but it was i like didn't finish it <SP2>
16633,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> yeah when i got to the genetics stuff i was like i already know this i'm like not gonna spend twenty pages reading that <SP1>
16634,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
16635,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> i got through section three point one <SP2>
16636,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> which is all like neuron <SP2>
16637,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> oh neurons and stuff i really do think it's interesting especially when you bring in like that chem knowledge <SP1>
16638,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> and you're like <SP1>
16639,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> oh no <SP2>
16640,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> stay away with that chem knowledge <SP2>
16641,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> you're like oh my god potassium <SP1>
16642,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> i know the sodium potassium chloride like the or the sodium potassium pumps <SP2>
16643,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
16644,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> and i was like oo trigger word like i know it <SP2>
16645,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
16646,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> did you learn about that in bio thirteen or are you gonna learn about do you do cells <SP1>
16647,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> in bio thirteen <SP2>
16648,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> in bio <SP1>
16649,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> bio f <SP2>
16650,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> freshman bio <SP1>
16651,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> bio thirteen was like cell stuff i don't think we did sodium potassium pumps though i don't remember those <SP2>
16652,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> no i don <SP1>
16653,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> but i did them in high school for like <SP2>
16654,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
16655,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> i think i i think that's where i remember them bio fourteen's like plants <SP2>
16656,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> was it about <SP1>
16657,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> no <SP2>
16658,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> was bio thirteen about like the human body at all or mostly just like <SP1>
16659,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> like a cellular level kind of stuff um i don't know it was like <SP2>
16660,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> like the nitty gritty stuff <SP2>
16661,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> mm <SP1>
16662,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> yeah yeah yeah yeah <SP1>
16663,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> but not like cell structure <SP2>
16664,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> like <SP1>
16665,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> not like mitochondria <SP2>
16666,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> like it came up once <SP2>
16667,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> photosynthesis <SP1>

17033,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> when is it <SP2>
17034,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> for freshman's it's april fifth so i can just chill <SP1>
17035,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> what that's so far away i love it <SP2>
17036,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> i know they give ten weeks for freshmen <SP1>
17037,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> that's so what i what is the pass fail thing like we can't do it for requirements <SP2>
17038,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> you can't do it for requirements but it counts towards your credit for graduation and it can't count towards any major requirements <SP1>
17039,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> so can it count towards so that so distribution requirements like i couldn't do history pass fail <SP2>
17040,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> no <SP1>
17041,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> you cannot do it pass fail <SP1>
17042,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> i know it's so annoying <SP1>
17043,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> then what's the point in taking something pass fail <SP2>
17044,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> because like for me like psych is just a pre requisite for like other cooler classes that i want to take later <SP1>
17045,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> oh mm <SP2>
17046,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> so it's not like <SP1>
17047,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> i see now <SP2>
17048,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> you know <SP1>
17049,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> cause that wouldn't be your major <SP2>
17050,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> it might <SP1>
17051,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> actually psych one isn't a part of the major <SP2>
17052,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> but even in the it's not <SP1>
17053,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> is it <SP2>
17054,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> it is part of the like the full on psych major but you can if i took child development i can replace it with different class like there is a loophole <SP1>
17055,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> mm <SP2>
17056,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> from t i dunno <SP1>
17057,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> okay <SP2>
17058,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> alright alright <SP2>
17059,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> but we'll see if it's easy or hard cause i have ten weeks to decide you know <SP1>
17060,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> yeah if you even like want to take it too <SP2>
17061,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
17062,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> it's pretty it's good <SP2>
17063,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
17064,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> mm <SP1>
17065,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> the add period's almost over <SP2>
17066,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> i know but i don't need any more <SP1>
17067,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
17068,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> classes <SP1>
17069,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> so <SP2>
17070,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> you don't want six what are you saying what are you saying take another lab <SP2>
17071,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> what <SP1>
17072,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> you can handle it <SP2>
17073,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> you can handle <SP1>
17074,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> oh my god i know so many people that are taking chem and bio and i'm like <SP1>
17075,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> why would you do that <SP2>
17076,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> to yourself <SP2>
17077,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> why <SP1>
17078,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> okay but this bio is a lot easier <SP2>
17079,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> than last bio <SP2>
17080,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17081,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> i did hear that <SP1>
17082,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> so if if you're gonna do it any semester it would probably be this one but <SP1>
17083,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> i should have done that like shoot <SP2>
17084,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> she <SP2>
17085,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> you have time <SP1>
17086,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> no god i'm not starting chem now <SP2>
17087,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> no no no <SP1>
17088,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> she s t she like had a powerpoint and it was like fifty four slides and i was like when do you have fifty four slides worth of content and three of the slides are literally just collages of animal pictures <SP2>
17089,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> and i was like i'm not printing this this is like two like two pa two color pages that's like forty cents <SP2>
17090,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17091,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> for animal pictures she's like i got these off google and i was like <SP2>
17092,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> there's no relevance <SP2>
17093,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> i got these off google <SP1>
17094,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> the only thing i learned in that class is that like beetles are so incredibly like popular and that there's so many beetles <SP2>
17095,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> it's like so useless to know this <SP2>
17096,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> wait so it's like plants and animals <SP1>
17097,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> yeah kind of it's a <SP2>
17098,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> insects <SP1>
17099,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> i'm forgetting the class name population she's like an a big fan of like evolutionary biology so that's kind of what her focus is like um we did something with like population growth and like looking at charts it's just stuff like you didn't take environmental science in high school right <SP2>
17100,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> no i took in like eighth grade <SP1>
17101,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> okay <SP2>
17102,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> so <SP1>
17103,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> it's like stuff you do in ap environmental science in high school <SP2>
17104,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> mm <SP1>
17105,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> like just like population change is k <SP2>
17106,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> oh yeah <SP1>
17107,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> and like all right <SP2>
17108,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> we did that a little bit in ap bio <SP1>
17109,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> yeah yeah they yeah <SP2>
17110,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17111,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> i heard that ap bio in high school i i didn't take it but it was like a mixture of apes and like bio <SP2>
17112,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> yeah i know people that took ap bio first and then took apes and they like knew it all <SP1>
17113,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
17114,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> or like most they had foundation for every topic <SP1>
17115,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> <SP2>
17116,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> and it was just like a little bit further <SP1>
17117,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
17118,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> apes is a joke we literally did a unit on like trash and like trash like landfills and i was like this is <SP2>
17119,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> you're like science <SP1>
17120,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> this is not what i wanna do <SP2>
17121,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> yeah oh my god <SP1>
17122,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> so much trash in the world <SP2>
17123,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> so much trash <SP1>
17124,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> do you also have a little plant in yours <SP2>
17125,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17126,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> is it in the same that's so weird <SP2>
17127,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17128,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> it looks like a mirror cause oh my god this like curtain looks like it's a mirror image but it's definitely a different curtain <SP1>
17129,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> it most definitely is but the cameras are aligned differently <SP2>
17130,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> oh shoot <SP1>
17131,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> that one's not <SP2>
17132,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> lies <SP1>
17133,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> i see you <SP2>
17134,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> i see you we're not in the same room <SP1>

17137,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> yeah yeah <SP1>
17138,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> cause i accidentally walked into like the basement <SP1>
17139,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> what <SP2>
17140,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> yeah <SP2>

17181,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> unless you live on the other side of campus oh where are you trying to get your suite <SP2>
17182,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> mm <SP1>
17183,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> is it haskell or wren <SP2>
17184,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> i don't really care i think they want haskell but there's a way <SP1>
17185,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> to like <SP1>
17186,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> they're gonna put up some sort of like <SP1>
17187,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> average calculator and average comparison i don't really know so you can see where you stand so if we're like too low for haskell <SP1>
17188,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> what's more like wanted haskell or wren <SP2>
17189,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP1> i have no idea <SP1>
17190,2018-01-29-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,21,<SP2> i hear it goes like i heard it used to be wren and now people really want haskell <SP2>

17336,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah and like that's like when they checked it out and everything and they were like oh yeah you should probably go to like lawrence memorial um and then i went there that was like a long wait cause it wasn't er it was <SP1>
17337,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> um <SP1>
17338,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> urgent c yeah exactly yeah <SP1>
17339,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> urgent care yeah yeah i went to urgent care too <SP2>
17340,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> um <SP1>
17341,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and so like that was like a whole process and like they said like nothing seems wrong like an and like and then they checked if it was like a fracture or anything like like a break or any <SP1>
17342,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> did they do an xray and stuff <SP2>
17343,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17344,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> um <SP1>
17345,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> so they were just like oh like then just like keep it elevated like ice and stuff like that so like and i had to do that for a week before i could go back to health services for like for that week i didn't do anything like i didn't go to work and like it was boring cause like i had to do all i did was like lay in bed and just like sleep for a long time and then wake up and i couldn't do anything again <SP1>
17346,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
17347,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and then like <SP1>
17348,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> i felt so needy too cause like my roommate like hadn't started working either and so i'd like have to like order food <SP1>
17349,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and then he'd have to go like get it for me because i couldn't like walk all the way down but yeah in the end like what it was like they didn't figure out what it was either um <SP1>
17350,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> they thought it was a what was it <SP1>
17351,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> like the health services doctor thought that it was like tendonitis or something <SP1>
17352,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> oh <SP2>
17353,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> like along the right side of my foot um but then when i started doing um what's it called <SP1>
17354,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> not <SP1>
17355,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> um <SP1>
17356,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> not therapy it's like <SP1>
17357,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> physical ther physical therapy <SP2>
17358,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah physical therapy yeah yeah <SP1>
17359,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and when i had to start doing like pt like that's when like the guy was like yeah he's like i'm pretty sure like you had like a stress fracture or like something like that <SP1>
17360,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> oh <SP2>
17361,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah it's like that was i did that for like basically like the rest of the summer and like couldn't go running at all and like <SP1>
17362,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> oh <SP2>
17363,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> do anything that like i wanted to do <SP1>
17364,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> which sucked yeah and then i hadn't like been running at all for a while the first time i actually ran was the day before thanksgiving <SP1>
17365,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> oh wow <SP2>
17366,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and like <SP1>
17367,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> i feel okay <SP1>
17368,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> is it fine now <SP2>
17369,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> i think yeah it's definitely gotten better like over like the past few months i think like at the beginning of school like i couldn't like put like if i stood on it for like normal stance for too long or like c like put slightly too much pressure like then it was like start being like <SP1>
17370,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> not hurting but just like uncomfortable and so like that's when i'd have to like shift my pressure like i think like now it's like almost normalized to like the point where like i think it if i had like to like stand for like a long time cause i'm in the choir so like sometimes we're like standing too long like that's when i'll feel like a little bit discomfort but yeah i think everything's like better <SP1>
17371,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
17372,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> but i think it's like like getting injured like i think during the school year it's just so much worse <SP1>
17373,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> yeah h <SP2>
17374,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> because i heard a story about a guy who's on the football team i think and then at the homecoming game he got hurt <SP1>
17375,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> oh <SP2>
17376,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and then i think he broke his leg or something happened but then he had to take like a semester off because like this school isn't like handicap accessible at all really <SP1>
17377,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
17378,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> because like every it's like all hill <SP1>
17379,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
17380,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and like there's a few places that have like ramps for like wheelchairs and stuff like that <SP1>
17381,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> right yeah <SP2>
17382,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17383,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> yeah i mean i kind of got lucky cause the timing of the surgery was meant that like i had the thanksgiving days off <SP2>
17384,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17385,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> and then i had the weekend <SP2>
17386,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> um <SP2>
17387,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> and then i took monday off and then like like i went to i came for classes on tuesday um but like i moved back to campus on wednesday cause i was staying um at a friend's apartment like i my parents came <SP2>
17388,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> mm <SP1>
17389,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> mm <SP1>
17390,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> to like help with everything <SP2>
17391,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> but like if if i'd had to have had the surgery like a different time i would like i would have had to miss way more class i don't know it just would've been it would've been harder <SP2>
17392,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> like if it's good because <SP2>
17393,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17394,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> like the surgery that i got now means i can still kind of like walk just it takes longer <SP2>
17395,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17396,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> but like there was an option for a different surgery wher e they would of reattached the piece of cartilage that fell off <SP2>
17397,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> oo <SP1>
17398,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> um <SP2>
17399,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> and like and they would've like replaced my ligament instead of just tightening it up <SP2>
17400,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> and so that would have been like a more major surgery like i would've been in more pain so in in like that case i would've missed like so much more school i would like been bedridden probably <SP2>
17401,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17402,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> and like so close to finals especially that would've just been such a nightmare <SP2>
17403,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and like not being yeah <SP1>
17404,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
17405,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> dang <SP1>
17406,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah i remember like i was sad like the day after i like went to like the hospital like my friends were coming um for um the ca do you know like the calling festival <SP1>
17407,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> no <SP2>
17408,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> well there's like a festival like close by um more towards like the city over the summer and um <SP1>
17409,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> <SP1>
17410,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> it's called so like i didn't have tickets well like i would've bought them but then like i just didn't have any money <SP1>
17411,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> um <SP1>
17412,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> so then but i like promised him like that i'd be like that i'd like go see them at least there so like i had to call number and and say hey no like can you like drive me to davis <SP1>
17413,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and then they did <SP1>
17414,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> which was really nice <SP1>
17415,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> there was just all a mess <SP1>
17416,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> how how far can you get them to drive you <SP2>
17417,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> um <SP1>
17418,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> i think if you're on a wheelchair or if you have like a specific like handicapped reason then like <SP1>
17419,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> i'm not exactly sure like how far i know definitely from like davis back to campus <SP1>
17420,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> i think so yeah <SP1>
17421,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> did you get them to drive you around campus too <SP2>
17422,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> no that was like the only time i really used them like other than that other than that it was like during that week i really just like stayed in the dorm <SP1>
17423,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17424,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> um <SP1>
17425,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> after that after that no i'd rather just like be going on crutches like kind of like around <SP1>
17426,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and like yeah cause after that week of using crutches which sucked i hated using crutches <SP1>
17427,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> yeah that's no fun <SP2>
17428,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17429,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> um <SP1>
17430,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and like then i just like up and was like <SP1>
17431,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> w walking around which i probably like should have been i probably should've been on crutches for like maybe like a week or two longer but <SP1>
17432,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
17433,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and i probably would've gone like better sooner but <SP1>
17434,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah that's what happened <SP1>
17435,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah i was like starting to get the hang of it too <SP1>
17436,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
17437,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> like using crutches like on stairs <SP1>
17438,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
17439,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> it's not <SP1>
17440,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> i like when i like the day after i hurt it when they give crutches they were like don't put any pressure on that leg so like that was hard cause i was basically like using them properly but after the surgery they were like you can put w eight on the leg so you just need to like use the crutches for support so it wasn't like hopping on them which was better <SP2>
17441,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17442,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> but they're still such a pain like i gave up on them on like wednesday <SP2>
17443,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah and it's also like i keep like reminding myself of it cause like it's so weird and like i like imagining how it's like for other people who like have to like use who can't can't like use their legs like for an extended period of time <SP1>
17444,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
17445,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> cause like in like ch like in that one week it's like <SP1>
17446,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> you know it's like when you're like normally walking and like you're kinda like doing like a calf extension so like then like <SP1>
17447,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
17448,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah so like because like i was putting like all my pressure like my left leg <SP1>
17449,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
17450,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> my like left calf muscle's like bigger now than like my right one <SP1>
17451,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and like i notice it a lot <SP1>
17452,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> yeah i can notice like this like this leg just like shrinking and getting smaller like <SP2>
17453,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17454,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> um like the calf especially like wh when i when the brace comes off and i can finally walk normally it's gonna to be so like uneven <SP2>
17455,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17456,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> gonna have to like do you like weights just on this leg <SP2>
17457,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> i'm <SP1>
17458,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> that's what like yeah w now when i'm like walking up memorial steps and stuff like that like i like making a conscious effort to like when i'm like stepping up i'm like using like my right leg <SP1>
17459,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> right right <SP2>
17460,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> to like start like <SP1>
17461,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> yeah building it up again <SP2>
17462,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17463,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17464,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> yeah cause that's that's the thing like i've been doing stairs one at a the time for like more than a month now since i got injured i haven't been working stairs normally even before the surgery so like i've always been putting more pressure on my left going up or like yeah <SP2>
17465,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> wait so like right now like when you have to get to classes like do you leave early from a different class do you have like permission to do that or do you ask <SP1>
17466,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> um <SP2>
17467,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> i don't actually need to because so the way i have classes i have i have arabic in olin before psych <SP2>
17468,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> okay <SP1>
17469,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> um <SP2>
17470,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> and so is right next to it so <SP2>
17471,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17472,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> i can make it that's fine um and then so i have that on tuesday thursday and those are the only classes i have tuesday thursday <SP2>
17473,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> okay <SP1>
17474,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> and then monday wednesday i have something in paige hall and then something in braker right after <SP2>
17475,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> okay <SP1>

17477,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> and that's also really close so i didn't have an issue making it to that <SP2>
17478,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and are you uphill or downhill <SP1>
17479,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> i'm up the hill and well i'm in hill i don't know if you'd call that uphill <SP2>

17584,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and then jumbo days <SP1>
17585,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> oh yeah <SP2>
17586,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> cause like all the pre os like advertise the jumbo days <SP1>

17589,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> but it'll be fun like i think both of my chords they're both amazing people and like i i know one a lot better than the other one but like i know the other <SP1>
17590,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
17591,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah they're both great like anyways <SP1>
17592,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> what so what do you actually do in focus <SP2>
17593,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> so the way focus is like structured is um it's actually no go starts the same time as focus does <SP1>
17594,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> yeah i think so <SP2>
17595,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> it's go focus and two start together and then fit cafe and squad start afterwards like i i think a day or two afterwards <SP1>
17596,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> oh no i think it was the other way around <SP2>
17597,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> oh was it <SP1>
17598,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> cause i remember for us go started on the twenty sixth and so three of them started on the twenty sixth and three started on the twenty fourth <SP2>
17599,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> oh right cause it's <SP1>
17600,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> um <SP1>
17601,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> okay no it's cafe cafe <SP1>
17602,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> g go and fit gogo and fit started on the same time cafe started earlier <SP2>
17603,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah cafe starts with two and focus and then go starts with fit and squad <SP1>
17604,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> okay yeah yeah <SP2>
17605,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> okay yeah <SP1>
17606,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> i knew it was either cafe or go yeah so um what's it's called <SP1>
17607,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> i think some change like a little bit now but like how it was like the past is that um so like you know like when you're signing up for like different pre os and stuff like that they have like descriptions so if you sign up for focus and you get accepted into focus um then there's gonna be like a second email that comes out and it'll really just be i think just information about yourself and then there's also um a bunch of different like subcategories of service what you want to do because focus is surroundings community service <SP1>
17608,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
17609,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> um so there's like arts advocacy children's advocacy like environmental homelessness lgbtq advocacy um <SP1>
17610,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> what else <SP1>
17611,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and there's like a bunch of other stuff like that too um each year there's always like new ones added on too and then once you like you choose like i think five your top five or something <SP1>
17612,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and then <SP1>
17613,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
17614,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> um <SP1>
17615,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> i'm like remembering this from like when i was a first year like i haven't like looked into this again um and then you like choose like you rank the ones that you want and then you just kind of like wish for the best <SP1>
17616,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> okay <SP2>
17617,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and then like later on like towards the end of the summer like or like i think mid july or something um the like sent you again like an email that has like your placement um and then like it also tells you like who else is in your group and then your leaders too <SP1>
17618,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
17619,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah so like the way like focus is structured in the past is that um everyone sleeps in churches <SP1>
17620,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> sometimes like people like literally sleep in churches but then other times is was like buildings that are like kind of like attached to a church that like <SP1>
17621,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> oh okay <SP2>
17622,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> they'll like sleep in like some of like those rooms um <SP1>
17623,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah and then um for each of like the different subcategories there's like there's not just one group for homelessness there's like homelessness one homelessness two homelessness three <SP1>
17624,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> mhm <SP2>

17626,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah what else can i say um it's also like it's really fun cause like than like well we kinda like stopped using family language i don't know if like you ever used like go brother or something <SP1>
17627,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> um <SP2>
17628,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> not really <SP2>
17629,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> i don't think so right cause like <SP1>
17630,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah i think it's more of like a thing for i think two i think for fit and focus cause like when you're in like a small group with like a few only like a few other people then like in the past like you kinda like would say like you were like a family and then you'd be like oh this is like my fo brother <SP1>
17631,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> uh huh <SP2>
17632,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and like my fo sister and stuff like that <SP1>
17633,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> oh yeah we we used to like joke about like my quincy was my adviser we used to like joke about her being our go mom but like <SP2>
17634,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> she like really hated that because <SP2>
17635,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah yeah <SP1>
17636,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> she's like really young for sophomore year and like i'm kind of old for the year so she's only like her birthday was during go <SP2>
17637,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> mm <SP1>
17638,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> um and she turned nineteen and like so she's basically a month older than me so she was like it's so weird for you to call me your go mom like that <SP2>
17639,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> that makes me sound so old but like i'm really not <SP2>
17640,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah we like it used to be like that in the past i know previous years like it wasn't like an issue last year <SP1>
17641,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> last when i was like a freshman um <SP1>
17642,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> like the leaders gave us the option it was kinda like opt either like opt in or out and it was like they like they're like oh this is what we did in the past like we used like a family language <SP1>
17643,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
17644,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> like if you like think like you're comfortable w ith it like we can totally use it if not like if there's like one person who was uncomfortable with it like then like we won't use it all all but just like text us anonymous and everything think everyone decided that we were fine with it um but then this year like we kinda just like completely like didn't make it an option we were just like no like family langauge at all and it's really just cause like it's really like exclusionary to like other freshman cause like when you're coming in like you're hearing like all these things about your fo family two fan and stuff like that <SP1>
17645,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
17646,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and then um like there's some people who like <SP1>
17647,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> didn't want to do pre o but then there's other people that genuinely like couldn't afford to do pre o <SP1>
17648,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
17649,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> and like makes some feel completely like out of it like i think like the first few weeks and like i know like a lot of people told me that and it's also like you really don't know like some people's family situation so like <SP1>
17650,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
17651,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> if like they really don't have like i said like the parent or guardian or something so <SP1>
17652,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> yeah that's true <SP2>
17653,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> you just have to be like we're those things yeah so then um also with folks it's like <SP1>
17654,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> with like <SP1>
17655,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> each church kinda like forms like a bond and stuff like that and then <SP1>
17656,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> most of the days like you're doing like one or two like service sites um and the support staff is really like there to like help like everyone out also like the courts with whatever they need but then also like to like drive them to different sites cause not everything's in like medford or somerville or boston like some of it's like almost like an hour away <SP1>

17658,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> so like they just like support staff is like in charge of driving and like picking up sites and then like going other places um but like every group also has like an off day and on the off day like they can do like whatever they want and like they also get like amount of money like they can spend to like if they wanna use like go to a restaurant or like go into boston like all of these other kind of things <SP1>
17659,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> yeah that's cool <SP2>
17660,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah i really liked it <SP1>
17661,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah <SP1>

17671,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> but i think like it's just like yeah <SP1>
17672,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> it's interesting for like some leaders i know who like go in and like expect to like have like a really like tight knit group and stuff but like it doesn't always like work out like that just cause like <SP1>
17673,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> mhm yeah <SP2>
17674,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> yeah it's just like something like i'm like <SP1>
17675,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> have to like consider when i'm like when i hire the staff and then like i'm assigning like leader pairs because then it's like i have to like some like i know like a lot of leaders but then i also like don't know some of them <SP1>

17679,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> that would just like cause like a weird like dynamic <SP1>
17680,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
17681,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> for their group <SP1>
17682,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> cause i like when on the first day of go and it was like really awkward and everybody was like doing introductions and stuff <SP2>
17683,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> um like <SP2>
17684,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> the advisors like kept on saying like oh yeah like everybody like makes so many friends during go and like it's quite often like you like the first person that you meet in and like who's in your go group and like you end up being best friends with them or whatever it and like you're friends for all four years whatever and <SP2>
17685,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> like that kind of just to me it sounded like ah that's just some pe <SP2>
17686,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> something that people say that doesn't actually happen kind of thing and like in my go group i like i wasn't that close with like everyone in the group but like um like two people in the group i had connections with anyways cause basically there was one girl who um was kind of a family friend like cause um our dads used to w work together <SP2>
17687,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> oh that's cool <SP1>
17688,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> uhm in new jersey <SP2>
17689,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> mm <SP1>
17690,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP2> and like so like i knew that she was gonna be at tufts and like we messaged but like we haven't really met like apparently we ha like knew each other when we were really little but lik e none of us remembered <SP2>
17691,2017-12-02-session-2b_nogaps_step1_GPT,22,<SP1> oh <SP1>

17931,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> really that's so small <SP2>
17932,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah but um on the graduating class was like forty students last year so i'm not worried people just might just switch in <SP1>
17933,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> switch back in yeah <SP2>
17934,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17935,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> i know a lot of people right now that are trying to switch into engineering <SP2>
17936,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> oh really <SP1>
17937,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
17938,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> i was thinking about switching to arts and science <SP1>
17939,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> really yeah i feel like once people get here they decide that they don't want to necessarily do what they've signed up for <SP2>
17940,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17941,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> but yeah i have a lot of friends that came here as arts and sciences got here and then decided they wanted to do engineering <SP2>
17942,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
17943,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> fair enough the reason why i want to switch to art and sciences is like i don't i don't like computer science <SP1>
17944,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> mm <SP2>
17945,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> i've heard comp fifteen is pretty hard <SP1>
17946,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah i heard that too <SP2>
17947,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> so but i have to take that cause that's kinda the requirements for engineering school i'm not sure but i have to take comp eleven so <SP1>
17948,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17949,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> and that is not my thing my plan is to take no computer science classes <SP2>
17950,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> what's your major <SP1>
17951,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> i wanna do either bio or bio psych <SP2>
17952,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
17953,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> and pre med <SP2>
17954,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> pre med <SP1>
17955,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> so lots and lots of science labs <SP2>
17956,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
17957,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> are you taking physics this semester <SP1>
17958,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> no i'm taking chem <SP2>
17959,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> chem <SP1>
17960,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> i heard comments like like i heard chem only has like eight thirty sessions like <SP1>
17961,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> there's an eight thirty which is the one that i'm in and there's a one thirty but i have practice during the one thirty so i'm in the eight thirty <SP2>
17962,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> my f my uh roommate he's actually doing chem next semester and the only time slot available form him is the eight thirty one <SP1>
17963,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> mm <SP2>
17964,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> that's kinda not good <SP1>
17965,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah i don't know it's good because then you get chem out of the way <SP2>
17966,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> that's true that's true <SP1>
17967,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> and then you can enjoy the rest of your day <SP2>
17968,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> that's true <SP1>
17969,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> cause you don't have to think about going to chemistry <SP2>
17970,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah i have math this semester eight thirty to nine twenty something for like three days <SP1>
17971,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> love a good eight thirty class i have eight thirties on monday <SP2>
17972,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
17973,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> and wednesday and then the rest is nine thirties <SP2>
17974,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> that's nice yeah my schedule this semester is kinda nice with thursdays and fridays cause i basically like my classes finish on thursday and fridays in the morning so like eight thirty to nine thirty and then like another ten thirty to eleven forty five <SP1>
17975,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> mm <SP2>
17976,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> to like n and like no classes in the afternoon <SP1>
17977,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> so <SP1>
17978,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> well that's good <SP2>
17979,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17980,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> i feel like the worst would be to have a whole bunch of classes on friday <SP2>
17981,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah no rest my goal for next semester is to have like three and three and a half days a weekend <SP1>
17982,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> ew <SP2>
17983,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> like my my schedule right now um it doesn't have classes on friday <SP1>
17984,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> wow <SP2>
17985,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> and there is no morning classes and you like yeah like so for monday wednesday and thursday i have class starts at one thirty ends about like eight or nine that's fine for me <SP1>
17986,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
17987,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> and on tuesday my class starts at three pm three thirty pm <SP1>
17988,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> starts at three <SP2>
17989,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
17990,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> wow <SP2>
17991,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> so like basically i can sleep my whole entire morning and then grab lunch and then go back probably go back to sleep again and then go to class <SP1>
17992,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> that sounds so nice my schedule for next semester i am trying to make it well i have to plan practice into my schedule <SP2>
17993,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
17994,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> and my practice is from one thirty to six on tuesdays through fridays yeah it's a long time <SP2>
17995,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
17996,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> so basically you don't have any free time in the afternoon <SP1>
17997,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> basically yeah and so i have mostly morning classes but the way that i have it set up which i hope works out i only have one class on friday and it's a chem recitation which isn't mandatory <SP2>
17998,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
17999,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> and then i only have one class on wednesdays also <SP2>
18000,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18001,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> but then i have two six thirty classes like six thirty pm monday i have a six thirty lab and thursday i have a six thirty class but it's fine <SP2>
18002,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> how many classes are youo taking um next semester <SP1>
18003,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> four <SP2>
18004,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> including the practice <SP1>
18005,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah i have chem english two french four and abnormal psych <SP2>
18006,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18007,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> i i feel like the practice it's kinda hard <SP1>
18008,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah it's a lot <SP2>
18009,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> i <SP1>
18010,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> i can never do like four to five or even three hours of might be three hours but not four hours of practice on a certain sports <SP1>
18011,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> it's nice though because like since our team has seventy people <SP2>
18012,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> which is huge compared to most sports <SP2>
18013,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> oh wow <SP1>
18014,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah yeah <SP1>
18015,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> uh so they don't really notice slash care if you're not there everyday <SP2>
18016,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18017,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> and also like there's two different times you can come at one thirty or you can come at three and then uh mondays we have no practice and wednesdays a lot of people don't go because they can't so like this semester i went i went tuesday thursday friday because i have class on wednesdays <SP2>
18018,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18019,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> and so it just works <SP2>
18020,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18021,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> gotcha <SP1>
18022,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> how far is it from here <SP1>
18023,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> ten minutes <SP2>
18024,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> oh <SP1>
18025,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> so we take cars <SP2>
18026,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> i see <SP1>
18027,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18028,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah i was uh i was i was planning to try some sports but i didn't get into basketball <SP1>
18029,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> uh <SP2>
18030,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> so that's kinda sucks but still play basketball casually with my friends <SP1>
18031,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> that's fun <SP2>
18032,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> it's just like the course load right now i i just finished my mid term last week <SP1>
18033,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> oh <SP2>
18034,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> so i'm so i'm just planning to pick up my basketball <SP1>
18035,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18036,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> hopefully there's gonna be no exams close by i know there's a psych paper right <SP1>
18037,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah the papers due next week <SP2>
18038,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> on november the fifteenth <SP1>
18039,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> but it's a short paper <SP2>
18040,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18041,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> it's like a <SP2>
18042,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> so like six hundred words <SP1>
18043,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah and like a mini summary of what you read <SP2>
18044,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18045,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> which is that's easy <SP2>
18046,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> i asked professor sommers about like what kind of articles he's looking for because like i was kind of confused if he's only <SP1>
18047,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> wanting us to find news articles or news plus psychology analysis <SP1>
18048,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18049,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> so so <SP1>
18050,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> what did he say <SP2>
18051,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> he he said on just anything anything would anything just related to psychology it's fine <SP1>
18052,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> i don't know <SP1>
18053,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah i need to find an article i was talking to someone yesterday who said she's doing hers on ptsd <SP2>
18054,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> oh ptsd that's nice <SP1>
18055,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> that's a that's a good one i feel like <SP2>
18056,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> i think i'm doing gender roles <SP1>
18057,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> oh that's also good <SP2>
18058,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> because like i'm not that into biological psychology it's just too hard for me <SP1>
18059,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> i prefer social psych <SP2>
18060,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> same <SP1>
18061,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> i'm really excited about this next unit because we're doing social psych and uh <SP2>
18062,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> media <SP1>
18063,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> disorders <SP2>
18064,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> oh disorders <SP1>
18065,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18066,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> which i think are the the cool parts <SP2>
18067,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm i feel like it's so cool to like an analyze behaviors <SP1>
18068,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18069,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> um back in my high school i still i used to take um advanced econ but this class is considered consisted off like multiple areas one part of the class we actually learn behavioral psych so that' really really cool <SP1>
18070,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> really <SP2>
18071,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> i i really like that <SP1>
18072,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18073,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> so that's pretty nice <SP1>
18074,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah that's why i wanna do abnormal psych <SP2>
18075,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
18076,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> because that class is about like different disorders <SP2>
18077,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> you learn about disorders which i think is the cool psych stuff <SP2>
18078,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> i like everything else <SP2>
18079,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18080,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> i just feel like it's more fun to to learn about what people do and don't do and also now that i've been in this class sometimes i see people and start thinking about what they're doing <SP2>
18081,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18082,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> like i am part of junior jumbo's <SP2>
18083,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>

18085,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> okay it's this club where you go to a preschool once a week for two hours and you have a little buddy and you play with them <SP2>
18086,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> like little kid my buddies three <SP2>
18087,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> three years old <SP1>
18088,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18089,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> and i went last week after we had learned about attachment styles <SP2>
18090,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> pretty cute <SP1>
18091,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> and then i was like man i'm watching it applied in real life <SP2>
18092,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18093,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah how long is the program like for the club thing <SP1>
18094,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> it's the whole year <SP2>
18095,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> that okay <SP1>
18096,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> do you gotta pick the same one next year as well if you are deciding to keep doing this club <SP1>
18097,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> pick the same what <SP2>
18098,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> like the same kid <SP1>
18099,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> no <SP2>
18100,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> so like basically one kid per year <SP1>
18101,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah except that someone i talked to said that oh it was a teacher that works in the preschool now that used to do the club she had one buddy for two years in a row <SP2>
18102,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18103,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> and then a third different one so i guess it just depends <SP2>
18104,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> because <SP2>
18105,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> cause i feel like i feel like it's gonna be so um <SP1>
18106,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> so cool i guess to keep in touch with the same person for like consecutive years <SP1>
18107,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> all of it yeah <SP2>
18108,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah to see what's happening around him or her <SP1>
18109,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> i feel like it depends on what age you get when you start off <SP2>
18110,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
18111,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> because since it's a preschool they get too old to be there <SP2>
18112,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18113,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> i think the oldest you can be there is five <SP2>
18114,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18115,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> so in theory i could have my buddy for two years like this year and the next year <SP2>
18116,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
18117,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> i don't know though <SP2>
18118,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> the youngest age is is less than two <SP2>
18119,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah they have baby babies <SP2>

18147,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> australia seems to be a really nice place my high school used to have like a exchange program to australia for twenty days <SP1>
18148,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> during a winter break <SP1>
18149,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> ugh <SP2>
18150,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> that's so cool <SP2>
18151,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah <SP1>

18159,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> that's right <SP1>
18160,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> also apparently the minimum wage in australia is really high <SP2>
18161,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> oh <SP1>
18162,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> it's like eighteen dollars eighteen us dollars the minimum wage in texas is seven fifty <SP2>
18163,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> for real <SP1>
18164,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah it's super i think whatever it super low <SP2>
18165,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18166,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> it's higher here than it is in texas i think it's like twelve here maybe fourteen i have no clue <SP2>

18172,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> at home but i feel like it would be smart to go work in australia because then you can save up a whole bunch of money and then bring it here <SP2>
18173,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> wait does tufts <SP1>
18174,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> to use <SP2>

18189,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> eventually <SP2>
18190,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> in my junior year or my my senior year i'm not sure cause the thing it's it's not only the culture but also the um my field in german so popular <SP1>
18191,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> like industrial design wise <SP1>
18192,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> oh <SP2>
18193,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> german has probably the best industrial design programs in the world <SP1>
18194,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18195,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> also britain but uh <SP1>
18196,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> you already speak english you're good <SP2>
18197,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18198,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> i'm trying to learn german <SP1>
18199,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah that's cool <SP2>
18200,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> at at least i'll yeah because if i'm going to study abroad i have to be like in german four <SP1>
18201,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> so that you can actually converse with people <SP2>
18202,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> right <SP1>
18203,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> i take french <SP2>
18204,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
18205,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> and i wanna go to france this summer the tufts and how are maybe we'll see um but yeah i don't know i've i've been taking french for so long that when i got here i was like well i feel like i have to continue so that i can actually learn how to speak it because french programs in texas are not very good so even though i took french for like five years <SP2>
18206,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
18207,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> i learned the exact same thing every year <SP2>
18208,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> which is nothing <SP2>
18209,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> hm <SP1>
18210,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> which isn't super helpful when you're trying to talk to people <SP2>
18211,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> true <SP1>
18212,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> are you still learn like two years i'm in actually one year of german back in my high school but that didn't help because we only have two classes per week and sometimes the teacher would not be there so basically have self studies <SP1>
18213,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> you only had class two days a week <SP2>
18214,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> no i meant two days for german <SP1>
18215,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> for for german <SP2>
18216,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18217,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> back at my high school <SP1>
18218,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> so that's not good because <SP1>
18219,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> wow <SP2>
18220,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18221,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> once i learn something on monday i'll basically forgot on friday <SP1>
18222,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18223,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> and over the weekend i have no incentive to review german then back to monday i basically forgot everything again <SP1>
18224,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah that's rough <SP2>
18225,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18226,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> so i basically didn't learn anything from my high school still start in college <SP1>
18227,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> you're you're starting over <SP2>
18228,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> i guess <SP1>
18229,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18230,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> that's okay german seems hard i have a friend that's in german one he seems like he's struggling a little bit <SP2>
18231,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18232,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> he said it's easy but also hard <SP2>
18233,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> at the same time <SP2>
18234,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> who is his what's his name <SP1>
18235,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> cole <SP2>
18236,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> cole <SP1>
18237,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah he's not in my section <SP1>
18238,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah so yeah german's pretty fun um <SP1>
18239,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18240,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> so are you gonna do did you test out of any of the language requirement <SP2>
18241,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> um i placed out of english cause i took ap english back in my high school um except for that one no <SP1>
18242,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> but i placed out of some like some physics and chemistry things <SP1>
18243,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> so that that that kind of helps <SP1>
18244,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> oh cool <SP2>
18245,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> that that that actually really helps saves my time next semester so that so that i don't have to wake up at eight thirty <SP1>

18251,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> so i have to take english two <SP2>
18252,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18253,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> and then for language i placed out of french two and th one and two <SP2>
18254,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> so you're starting in french three <SP1>
18255,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> so i'm in th <SP2>
18256,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18257,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> that's really nice i think <SP1>
18258,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah so i'm gonna do three and then i'm doing four next semester and then if i go to france over the summer i'll do five there <SP2>
18259,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18260,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> and then six when i come back <SP2>
18261,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> it's nice i don't th <SP1>
18262,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18263,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah for me i'm yeah i'm planning to do like german one two three four for my sophomore and freshman year <SP1>
18264,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> and then are you gonna do <SP2>
18265,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> study abroad <SP1>
18266,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> hm <SP2>
18267,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> probably <SP1>
18268,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> if i have that time <SP1>
18269,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> i really want to <SP1>
18270,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah i feel like study abroad would be so fun <SP2>
18271,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18272,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> would you go for a year or would you go for a semester <SP2>
18273,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> i'll probably go for one semester <SP1>
18274,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah me too i feel like it's just it just makes more sense to only go for a semester <SP2>
18275,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> because then that way like you don't fall behind <SP2>
18276,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> right <SP1>
18277,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> in anything <SP2>
18278,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
18279,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah i don't miss my family and my friends here so <SP1>
18280,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah yeah because if you but also the good thing about if you go abroad junior year is like most people are also going abroad junior year <SP2>
18281,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18282,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> so like you and your friends might be gone at the same time so then you come back <SP2>
18283,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> true <SP1>
18284,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> and it's not like like it wouldn't be fun if your friend went abroad like sophomore year and then you go junior year <SP2>
18285,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18286,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> and then you're like friends only for freshman and senior year <SP2>
18287,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18288,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> true <SP1>
18289,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah and another thing i'm kind of worry about studying abroad it's like <SP1>
18290,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> uh a definitely language problems cause although i might study one two three four that doesn't mean like it's gonna help me in the daily conversations <SP1>
18291,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18292,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18293,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> still so is the same thing cause we we took english classes back in china but those classes don't necessarily prepare you for english conversations <SP1>
18294,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah that's fair <SP2>
18295,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> like <SP1>
18296,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah so like it's only test prep <SP1>
18297,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> it's different <SP2>
18298,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18299,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18300,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> but the good thing also about studying abroad is that like once you get there by the time you leave you're gonna be so good at conversation <SP2>
18301,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18302,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<SP2> cause you'll only be speaking for the most part in that language for a good chunk of your time for an entire semester <SP2>
18303,2018-11-06-session-1_nogaps_step1_GPT,23,<END>

18584,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18585,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> um yeah and then um tuesday and thursday i also have night classes which is rough <SP1>
18586,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> aw <SP2>
18587,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> but <SP1>
18588,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> i guess that's what happens when you don't start classes until one thirty <SP1>
18589,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18590,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> um when's your stats lab <SP1>
18591,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> um when is it oh s friday <SP2>
18592,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> because it was the only one left <SP2>
18593,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18594,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18595,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> when i registered i registered like one week late actually <SP2>
18596,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> oh yeah <SP1>
18597,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> so it's from one thirty to four but it only takes one hour <SP2>
18598,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> wait so is mine <SP1>
18599,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> so <SP2>
18600,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah yeah no <SP1>
18601,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> when is yours <SP2>
18602,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> it's <SP1>
18603,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> friday at one thirty <SP1>
18604,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> oh <SP2>
18605,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> are we in the same lab <SP2>
18606,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18607,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> i guess <SP1>
18608,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> that's funny yeah um it it it says it's like one thirty to four <SP1>
18609,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18610,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> literally have not left like after two thirty <SP1>
18611,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18612,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> ever <SP1>
18613,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> which is <SP1>
18614,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> it's like nice but also you have to like tell people that there's a chance that it could go until four <SP1>
18615,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> like like although it's like that me and my partner are always the last persons to leave the class <SP2>
18616,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> oh really <SP1>
18617,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> because we never study the material at the right time <SP2>
18618,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18619,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> so <SP2>
18620,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18621,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> we have to learn them then apply them <SP2>
18622,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18623,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah in the lab <SP1>
18624,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18625,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> at least the lab ta she's like pretty helpful <SP1>
18626,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> i feel like <SP1>
18627,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah yeah yeah yeah <SP2>
18628,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> if you like ask her to come over and help <SP1>

18698,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> like after changing the major i did some research like what does an applied math major do <SP2>
18699,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18700,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> has worked like data analysis t is the like foremost job <SP2>
18701,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18702,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
18703,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> mm i would say so and they need to know some mm programming languages <SP2>
18704,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
18705,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> so i bought them online online courses for them and i'm gonna start studying them <SP2>
18706,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> oh cool <SP1>
18707,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> that's cool yeah <SP1>
18708,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> python and r i think those two <SP2>
18709,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> python yeah <SP1>
18710,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> what about you <SP2>
18711,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> you know i don't really know <SP1>
18712,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> um i'm gonna try and do a lab over the summer to like see if i would want to do research because i feel like a lot of cbs goes into research <SP1>
18713,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
18714,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> um but other than that like maybe possibly ai or something like that <SP1>
18715,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
18716,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> which would like combine comp sci and cbs <SP1>
18717,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> s yeah <SP2>
18718,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah um but i also have not taken an ai course at all yet so i don't know <SP1>
18719,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> um are the ir courses under cs or under cbs <SP2>
18720,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18721,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> uh they're in the cs department <SP1>
18722,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> oh <SP2>
18723,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah um so they might be difficult <SP1>
18724,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> what are your plans for the summer like stay here or go someplace else <SP2>
18725,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> i think i'm gonna go back to seattle um because there's actually <SP1>
18726,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18727,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> there are lots of <SP2>
18728,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18729,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of tech <SP1>
18730,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> tech farms and <SP2>
18731,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> and there's a lot of um research in neuroscience being done there at like at the university of washington <SP1>
18732,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18733,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> um so i might as well just go home for the summer <SP1>
18734,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> um <SP1>
18735,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> but we'll see and maybe the summer after that i'll i'd stay here <SP1>
18736,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> mm <SP2>
18737,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> also cause i don't know where i wanna live after college have not thought about that at all so <SP1>
18738,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> do you know where you are living next year <SP2>
18739,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> oh yeah we just signed on a house <SP1>
18740,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> um <SP1>
18741,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> where <SP2>
18742,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> um thirty two adams street <SP1>
18743,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> so it's like uh it's like behind carm <SP1>
18744,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> oh <SP2>
18745,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah like a little bit further down <SP1>
18746,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> mm it's nice <SP2>
18747,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18748,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> like we looked at that place too but we ended up <SP2>
18749,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> uh signing the lease at what was that two oh five college ave <SP2>

18816,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> i can't dec it honestly bothers me a little bit that we had to be on unlimited last year <SP1>
18817,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18818,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> um because it's just so much more <SP1>
18819,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18820,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> like it's nice in the very beginning when you just don't have to think about it but also i did not use i did not need unlimited <SP1>
18821,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah and it made me gain the freshman fifteen <SP2>
18822,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> luckily i could use like lose the freshman fifteen in the second semester <SP2>
18823,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18824,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah so <SP2>
18825,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah i'm getting sick i apologize <SP1>

18829,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> so i knew it was coming <SP1>
18830,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> did you get the flu shot <SP2>
18831,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah i did yeah so it's not the flu of just the cold <SP1>
18832,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18833,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> it's very helpful like less year only one of one friend in my friend group didn't get the shot and she sick for like three months <SP2>
18834,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> oh really that sucks yeah no the flu shot is nice i i'd never i never got them like back home <SP1>
18835,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah like my f my father is a ph sh what p a doctor for children <SP2>
18836,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> mm <SP1>
18837,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> what do you call that i forget it <SP2>
18838,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> pediatrician yeah <SP1>
18839,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> pediatrician <SP2>
18840,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18841,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18842,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> so like he's so against the idea of flu shots but like since it's so cold here like <SP2>
18843,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah that's true <SP1>
18844,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> i told i had to take <SP2>
18845,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
18846,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> the shot <SP2>
18847,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> and i mean it's free they do it quickly <SP1>
18848,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18849,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> so you might as well um as long as you don't have a bad reaction and like you get the flu from it <SP1>
18850,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18851,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah one of my friends didn't get it and actually my roommate is the friend who didn't get it so hopefully she doesn't get the flu um but <SP1>
18852,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> it was easy enough <SP1>
18853,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18854,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> might as well <SP1>
18855,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> but i i heard that this winter isn't gonna be so cold it's gonna be a kind of warmer winter <SP2>
18856,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> really <SP1>
18857,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18858,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah i don't know i've heard like very very mixed things i've heard both um but i feel like there's always people predicting what it's going to be <SP1>
18859,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18860,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> and it never actually is i would be very fine with some snow days i would like that <SP1>
18861,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18862,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> the problem is when it's really really cold but not a snow day <SP1>
18863,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> but i hate that like in snow days they also shut down the libraries and stuffs <SP2>
18864,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
18865,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> so i have no place else to study <SP2>
18866,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> i never can study at my f room <SP2>
18867,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> that's true <SP1>
18868,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah like the room or the or the dining hall <SP1>
18869,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> so <SP2>
18870,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> it's like the room or the or the dining hall <SP1>
18871,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
18872,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> yeah and it's hard um most of my friends live up hill like in carm <SP1>
18873,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
18874,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> um so that'll be interesting on snow days like having to trek up there <SP1>
18875,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP2> yeah like last year i was at south and <SP2>
18876,2017-10-31-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,24,<SP1> oh <SP1>

19258,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> how do they clean these microphones <SP1>
19259,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> oo that's a good question <SP2>
19260,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> they probably have some spray and it's probably just like very concentrated <SP2>
19261,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> i just feel bad cause if we're coughing all up on this microphone and then somebody else gets it just like in their mouth <SP1>
19262,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> antibacterial <SP2>
19263,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> you you just coughed on it directly when i said that <SP1>
19264,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> oh yeah <SP2>

19271,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> that was like a close call <SP2>
19272,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> we can do this <SP2>
19273,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> that was a close call <SP1>
19274,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> did your alarm go off <SP1>
19275,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> mhm <SP2>

19283,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> it's just <SP2>
19284,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> i'm just like so asleep that i won't wake up <SP2>
19285,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> you're a very very deep sleeper <SP1>
19286,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> till one <SP2>
19287,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> to one so i gotta put on at least three <SP2>
19288,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> and they're not e like <SP1>
19289,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> they're all like the worst possible alarm sounds <SP1>
19290,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> and i still don't get up <SP2>
19291,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> that's insane <SP1>
19292,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> oh my god <SP1>
19293,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> what is <SP2>
19294,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> at least it's not like do you remember last year <SP1>
19295,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> happening <SP2>
19296,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> when like you're like beeping one would go off <SP1>
19297,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> and then i would go to the bathroom <SP2>
19298,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> and then it would keep beep and i would have to get up but like i didn't know how to turn it off <SP1>
19299,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> you just like threw the alarm clock at the door <SP2>
19300,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> i was like kept pressing buttons and then eventually it would stop but then sometimes i also hit snooze so then i would get back in bed and then it'd go off again honestly i normally just unplugged it <SP1>
19301,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> and then i wouldn't notice and that's why i probably wouldn't get up the next day we'll just leave it at that <SP2>
19302,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> cause it still says the time even if you unplug it <SP2>
19303,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> it's weird <SP2>
19304,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> really <SP1>
19305,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
19306,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> for like a couple hours and then it goes away <SP2>
19307,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> that's so weird <SP1>
19308,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
19309,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> why would they do that <SP1>
19310,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> mm mm mm <SP2>
19311,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> that's very sus <SP1>
19312,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> plus my times wrong it's like two minutes <SP2>
19313,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> fix it <SP1>
19314,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> behind <SP2>
19315,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> i've been too lazy <SP2>
19316,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> i know i always think that's it's like good for me to be behind but it's better to be ahead <SP2>
19317,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> yeah then it just makes you late to everything <SP1>
19318,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> it really does <SP2>
19319,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> i should put it two minutes ahead <SP2>
19320,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> i heard that <SP2>
19321,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> or you could set it to the real time <SP1>
19322,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> that's just a thought though <SP1>
19323,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> what good would that do <SP2>
19324,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> i don't know then you would know what time it is <SP1>
19325,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> can you see under this <SP1>

19421,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> it's just like a random walkway it's like a bridge <SP2>
19422,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> cause there's like nothing underneath definition of a bridge <SP2>

19426,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> i need to sneeze <SP2>
19427,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> don't do it don't do it <SP1>
19428,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> it's gonna hurt if i keep it in <SP2>
19429,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> you can do it <SP1>
19430,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> but that's a good location <SP2>
19431,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> that is a good locat is that the four person one <SP1>
19432,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
19433,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> and i don't think nine hundred's too bad but that's six person one with the pool <SP2>
19434,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> okay i don't know if that's gonna happen or not though he was like they have an open house for that today <SP1>
19435,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> ew it feels like you're coughing into my ear <SP1>
19436,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> hey <SP2>
19437,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> but they have an open house for it today but like i asked if he was like sure that it was available for like the time we need it <SP1>
19438,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
19439,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> and he was like i'm somewhat sure like i'll let you know as soon as i find out <SP1>
19440,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> and like i'm not trying to go to the open house <SP1>
19441,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> mm mm <SP2>
19442,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> and also like if it is not as cheap as i think it is <SP1>
19443,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> how would it not be <SP2>
19444,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> it might not be i don't know dude it has a pool which is super unnecessary <SP1>
19445,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> but also doesn't raise the hi price of the house <SP2>
19446,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> i feel like it would <SP1>
19447,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> right <SP2>
19448,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> i feel it would be more expensive <SP1>
19449,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
19450,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> maybe we're not allowed to use it <SP2>
19451,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> no it says <SP1>
19452,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> pool for those hot summer days so i feel like it's not just to like be there <SP1>
19453,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> that's fair <SP2>
19454,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> i don't know i want him to hit me back and be like it's available and it's this cheap <SP1>
19455,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> it's not a lie and it's close to davis or closer in that direction <SP2>
19456,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> it's in it's more like if you just from the bottom of tufts went sideways <SP1>
19457,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> mm <SP2>
19458,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> does that make any sense <SP1>
19459,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> it's like i'm picturing near the round about now <SP2>
19460,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> yeah it's like if from the round about you went like <SP1>
19461,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> away from tufts but not downwards towards davis like to the right <SP1>
19462,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> like towards the pub <SP2>
19463,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> i don't know dude <SP1>
19464,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> mm <SP2>
19465,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> it's on harvard street <SP1>
19466,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> fuck harvard <SP2>
19467,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> okay it's not at like harvard university <SP1>
19468,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> obviously but that was my first reaction <SP2>

19480,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> i'm guessing it's for like <SP1>
19481,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> okay i thought it was like <SP1>
19482,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> continuity perspective <SP2>
19483,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> yeah its definitely like for like controls <SP1>
19484,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> but like <SP1>
19485,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> oh yeah <SP2>
19486,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> it's kinda sus because it makes us look like a mirror cause i think this window like looks weird <SP1>
19487,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP1> maybe it's just cause it's really like clean <SP1>
19488,2018-10-20-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,25,<SP2> maybe they could make it a like one right mirror or a two way mirror like they could have different effects on it it's high tech <SP2>

19797,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> um i thought it was gonna be a math class but i can probably <SP1>
19798,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> try to get it to count for the math <SP1>
19799,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
19800,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> um i'll fight for it <SP1>
19801,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>

19859,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> because i feel like i'd get tired of it if it was the same person every day lecturing me the same way <SP1>
19860,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
19861,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> like it keeps us off balance it's nice <SP1>
19862,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah definitely <SP2>
19863,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> and they lecture so differently which is nice too <SP1>
19864,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> i know it's the videos the other day were so funny <SP2>
19865,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
19866,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> that helps <SP1>
19867,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> every time they show the office i'm like ah i've seen that episode <SP1>

19876,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> see i watched like one episode a day <SP1>
19877,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> so i'm <SP1>
19878,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> oh <SP2>
19879,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> maybe two <SP1>
19880,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> and they're quick <SP2>
19881,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> right <SP2>
19882,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> and there's t twenty minute episodes <SP1>
19883,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> they're like twenty minutes <SP2>
19884,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
19885,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
19886,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> um i think one of the seasons has all forty minute episodes but it's half the amount of episodes <SP1>
19887,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> okay <SP2>
19888,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> so <SP1>
19889,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> i don't know why they did that <SP1>
19890,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah that's weird <SP2>
19891,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> but <SP1>
19892,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> to change it up <SP2>
19893,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> no it's a good show cause all my other um shows that i was quote unquote binging um ended so <SP1>
19894,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> oh okay <SP2>
19895,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> or i finished them already <SP1>
19896,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> oh <SP2>
19897,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> so that helps so i had to get a new one <SP1>

19982,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> it's the peripheral vision that's thrown off <SP1>
19983,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah and like when i'm like especially when i'm going downstair like walking downstairs <SP2>
19984,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> oh yeah <SP1>
19985,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> with them on <SP2>
19986,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> cause then i <SP2>
19987,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> then they shake a little bit and so yeah <SP1>

19991,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> when i look down down like i can't see anything it's just blurry <SP2>
19992,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> you'll see like just below anything at it's awful <SP1>
19993,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> then i get thrown off <SP2>
19994,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> even worse so like before i wore contacts like the glasses made sense but now that i've worn contacts f for a good amount of time now when i put the glasses on everything is like so different <SP1>
19995,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
19996,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah like you can't go back <SP2>
19997,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah i do every once in a while because i have to <SP1>
19998,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> it's a weird <SP2>
19999,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
20000,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> but like <SP1>
20001,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> it's so weird <SP1>
20002,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah it's like getting your eyes a break or whatever they say but like i i'm like no that's not happening <SP2>
20003,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah it's it is what it is <SP1>
20004,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20005,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah even worse is like when you go a couple days in a row where you've like stayed up too late and wear the contacts for a long period of time <SP1>
20006,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20007,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> and then like your eyes are just generally bloodshot <SP1>
20008,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> i know <SP2>
20009,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> it's awful <SP1>

20019,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> the scariest part is that i drove home like i drove home with only one contact in and don't even notice <SP1>
20020,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> that's so weir is there what's your prescription is it that <SP2>

20068,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20069,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20070,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> that's so f <SP2>
20071,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> except for cross country i never had problems with glasses in cross country <SP1>
20072,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> no <SP2>

20078,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> oh gosh really <SP2>
20079,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> it's yeah most likely doing something clumsy not even not even playing sports <SP1>
20080,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> that's f <SP2>
20081,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> like i had three concussions in a month once <SP1>
20082,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> not good <SP2>
20083,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> i don't play any contact sports <SP1>
20084,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> what <SP2>
20085,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20086,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> how <SP2>
20087,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> well first one i got in choir <SP1>
20088,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> okay <SP2>
20089,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> um my friend accidentally hit me in the head <SP1>
20090,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> oh gosh <SP2>
20091,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> so it was a small one the day i came back from that concussion someone hit me in the face with a basketball just like down like in the hall um the day i came back from that concussion i tripped and fell hit my head on a metal pole <SP1>
20092,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> that's such bad luck <SP2>
20093,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah it's fine i mean it's tough i couldn't have lost that much brain cells <SP1>
20094,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> my friend had one and she was out of school for like two months <SP2>
20095,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> damn <SP1>
20096,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> it was terrible <SP2>
20097,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> was a sports concussion though <SP1>
20098,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah so she was heading the she's a center back <SP2>
20099,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> that makes sense <SP1>
20100,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> okay <SP1>
20101,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> and she was heading the ball and like it hit her too high up instead of on the forehead <SP2>
20102,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> that makes sense <SP1>
20103,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> and she lost s like it was during our junior junior year of high school and she couldn't play or she couldn't she stopped playing after she got the concussion cause she was too afraid and then she like it affected all her like acts sats and like all of our classes <SP2>
20104,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20105,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> that's awful <SP1>
20106,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> she made it to duke so i think she's doing okay <SP2>
20107,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> i think she's doing fine <SP1>
20108,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> doesn't really matter <SP2>
20109,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20110,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> it worked out <SP2>
20111,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> at least it worked out <SP1>
20112,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> injuries suck though <SP2>
20113,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah i hate getting injured <SP1>

20154,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> uh huh <SP2>
20155,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> like i did comedy when i was like thirteen <SP1>
20156,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> okay <SP2>
20157,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> and like before i had any idea of what was actually funny <SP1>
20158,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20159,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> um so now it's different like i'm writing jokes like all the time <SP1>
20160,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> uh huh <SP2>
20161,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> now cause it's just finally i'll think of something funny and i'll write it down where as before i wouldn't think to write that down i would just like <SP1>
20162,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20163,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> think of something funny <SP1>
20164,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> that's so fun <SP2>
20165,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> that's so interesting <SP2>
20166,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> so <SP1>
20167,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah even better is when i actually have the tell the jokes um because sometimes i'll just write down a a key word <SP1>
20168,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20169,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> like a like a word that if anyone read it like they would have no idea what i possibly mean by that <SP1>
20170,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20171,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> and then sometimes i'll forget what they mean <SP1>
20172,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> uh huh <SP2>
20173,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> and it ruins the whole joke i'll just be like binoculars i don't know that joke is like <SP1>
20174,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> is it like scripted when you do it or is it more <SP2>
20175,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> some of it's scripted mostly not though it's mostly like i've written like part of a joke down and i'll like no matter how i tell it that's the joke is <SP1>
20176,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> okay <SP2>
20177,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> i try to write as little as possible down so i can like consolidate space <SP1>
20178,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> uh huh <SP2>
20179,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> um but other jokes have to be scripted because i can't be told otherwise <SP1>
20180,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah so like tonight when you go to the thing will you like have a set like something like prepared for it or is it more just like you'll go up there and <SP2>

20410,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> so ours is like a lo we have the hill dorms i've seen used <SP2>
20411,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> hills are huge <SP1>
20412,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> they're so big so the doubles are nor like p a wonderful size <SP2>
20413,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20414,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> but ours is just like the exact same size but with three people living in it so it feels way smaller so like we have a lofted bed with she's all our stuff underneath and then we have our bunk bed <SP2>
20415,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
20416,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> and i was the last of the rooms so on the top of the bunkbed <SP2>
20417,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> mm <SP1>
20418,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> which kind of sucks but it's kinda cozy up there <SP2>
20419,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> that works <SP1>
20420,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> it just sucks cause i can't fold my laundry <SP2>
20421,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> oof <SP1>
20422,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> it's hard to do that <SP2>
20423,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah i don't i i feel like living in hill has a lot of benefits <SP1>
20424,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
20425,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> like room size being one of them <SP1>

20430,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> like because of the like <SP2>
20431,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> like cause the way it's set up at this point like it's not that far it's like three feet <SP1>
20432,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> mhm <SP2>

20441,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah we'll figure it out um worst case scenario we don't move it out because we've been using his storage space <SP1>
20442,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> okay <SP2>
20443,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> so <SP1>
20444,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> that's nice though <SP2>
20445,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> not a big deal <SP1>

20554,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> it's so far <SP2>
20555,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20556,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> especially now that it's cold it's pretty bad <SP2>
20557,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> but being uphill has its benefits because if you're not going all the way down hill before class like you're at the same level as the classes like i have to walk uphill to every class <SP1>
20558,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20559,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> that's true <SP2>
20560,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> and have enough of a break time in between classes where i have to go back to my dorm to like do like do work and do things <SP1>
20561,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
20562,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20563,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> and then go back to class so i'm walking uphill like three or four times a day minimum <SP1>
20564,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah where are most of your classes <SP2>
20565,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> um probably like they're in the academic quad mostly <SP1>
20566,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> okay <SP2>
20567,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> but um it's nice i have one class in granoff so <SP1>
20568,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> uhuh <SP2>
20569,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> i don't have to walk very far for that <SP1>
20570,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> that's nice yeah mine is i've one in granoff too and then <SP2>
20571,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> i have one in eaton so that's kinda <SP2>
20572,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> okay <SP1>
20573,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> i don't know what that counts as <SP2>
20574,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> think it's still the academic quad <SP1>
20575,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah and then olin and then psych <SP2>
20576,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20577,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> so <SP2>
20578,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> not bad <SP1>
20579,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> not bad <SP2>
20580,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> it works out <SP1>
20581,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah i feel like if i were coming from hill oli like going to olin and going to psych would be so easy <SP2>
20582,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20583,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> but like eaton in granoff doesn't really ap matter <SP2>
20584,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah granoff's really easy for me <SP1>
20585,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> it would be the same from anywhere <SP2>
20586,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20587,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> cause it's like a one minute walk from hodge <SP1>
20588,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah i have four classes on tuesdays and thursdays <SP2>
20589,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> really <SP1>
20590,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> but then on i have no classes wednesday and i only have one class on monday and friday so it's like a weird like i a pretty much always have a four day weekend <SP2>
20591,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> that works <SP1>
20592,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> which is nice <SP2>
20593,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah i set up my classes differently i have two on monday tuesday wednesday and thursday <SP1>
20594,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> okay <SP2>
20595,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> and then i have one recitation on friday <SP1>
20596,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> that's nice <SP2>
20597,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> um so it works out <SP1>
20598,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> that's really evenly broken up <SP2>
20599,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah and i thought that would be beneficial it's not <SP1>
20600,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> you don't like it <SP2>
20601,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> it just means i have work due every day <SP1>
20602,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah that's what i like about having wednesdays off <SP2>
20603,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
20604,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> cause like i don't really have to do stuff tuesday night <SP2>
20605,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20606,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> but like i can if i wanna get ahead and then i don't have to do anything thursday nights <SP2>
20607,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> that works <SP1>
20608,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> like i would do it again i think but i also end up wasting a lot of time cause my classes like if i don't i don't have class till six pm on monday <SP2>
20609,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> so i end up just like sleeping in too late <SP2>
20610,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> really <SP1>
20611,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> but you get you get you get <SP2>
20612,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah i mean i have class at nine on tuesdays and thursdays i hate that <SP1>
20613,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20614,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> and it's so early <SP1>
20615,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> i have yeah i have i have that too <SP2>
20616,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> and it's weird <SP1>
20617,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> i have english <SP2>
20618,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> cause like i had to wake up to be at school at eight in high school <SP1>
20619,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
20620,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> like i thought that was early and i think this is early even though it's later <SP1>
20621,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah like getting up at eight <SP2>
20622,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> i think it's <SP1>
20623,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> like i get up at eight for my nine ams <SP2>
20624,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20625,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> i feel like next semster i'm gonna try and go for everything after ten <SP2>
20626,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah for sure <SP1>
20627,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> especially cause now like at least first semester i can't have any classes between three and five six three and six so like i have the that whole chunk of time like i couldn't put anything in my schedule for that but now i'm more flexible <SP2>
20628,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> that makes sense <SP1>
20629,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah cause of soccer sports yeah <SP1>
20630,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah but i'm still trying to have wednesdays off it's really nice cause it's like it breaks up the week <SP2>
20631,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> it breaks up the week yeah that would be that would be probably the most beneficial day to have off <SP1>
20632,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah it's like you don't like fridays off are nice but having one class on fridays isn't the end of the world <SP2>
20633,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> no i have a rescitation that's not mandatory <SP1>
20634,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20635,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> and like its <SP1>
20636,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> what for what class is it <SP2>
20637,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> for stats <SP1>
20638,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> okay <SP2>
20639,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> um i only have to show up if like when i pressing questions or to like we're actually learning something and they tell us in advance <SP1>
20640,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
20641,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> okay <SP2>
20642,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> um so that helps <SP1>
20643,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah do you do so do each your classes only meet twice a week except sta <SP2>
20644,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> e yes except for stats which has three <SP1>
20645,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> including rescitation <SP1>
20646,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> okay <SP2>
20647,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> okay <SP2>
20648,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> but yeah it's nice <SP1>
20649,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20650,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> one of my friends has rescitations for all of his classes <SP1>
20651,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> uh huh <SP2>
20652,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> and he's constantly going from like class to recitation to class <SP1>
20653,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20654,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> and like he didn't do a good job spreading out his recitations either <SP1>
20655,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
20656,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> on fridays he has three classes and and which are all recitations and are all mandatory <SP1>
20657,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> oh my gosh i'm worried for next semester cause i'm trying to take five classes <SP2>
20658,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> same though <SP1>
20659,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> and then like most of them like if i take econ i'll have a rescitation <SP2>
20660,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> okay <SP1>
20661,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> french two will have a rescitation <SP2>
20662,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20663,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> i wanna take computer science <SP2>
20664,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> i do too but i don't know when i want to take it <SP1>
20665,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> i know <SP2>
20666,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> like i want to take next semester but i feel like next semester's like when everyone who didn't take it first semester's gonna take it <SP1>
20667,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> i know <SP2>
20668,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> i don't it want to be a super busy class i want to be able to like learn well for that class <SP1>
20669,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20670,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> i've just heard that there's like one really really good professor and one who is not good at all <SP2>
20671,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> well i don't know which is which <SP1>
20672,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> i know i need to figure it out too my one friend was like <SP2>
20673,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> rate my professor <SP1>
20674,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20675,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> work works really well <SP1>
20676,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> that is a good one <SP2>
20677,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> my one friend told me like if you take it with her you're golden but you can't take it with this person or whatever <SP2>
20678,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20679,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> that works <SP1>
20680,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> so we'll see <SP2>
20681,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20682,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20683,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> i don't know <SP1>
20684,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> i i just don't know like my next semester is going to be so much worse than this one was <SP2>
20685,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah that's how i feel <SP1>
20686,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> but <SP2>
20687,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> i took four pretty easy classes <SP1>
20688,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah me too <SP2>
20689,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> or classes that don't have a lot of work <SP1>
20690,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20691,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> so ah <SP1>
20692,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> like psych is work heavy but it's like conceptually <SP2>
20693,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> it's reading heavy <SP1>
20694,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> it's reading heavy <SP2>
20695,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> which takes a long time but isn't that hard <SP1>
20696,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah and like i feel like my notes i'm so particular about how i take my notes that it takes even longer like <SP2>
20697,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> do you take notes and read at that like you take notes while you read <SP1>
20698,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> so i like have tried everything like oh i used to go paragraph by paragraph which i know you're not supposed to do <SP2>
20699,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
20700,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> but so then like this past time for chapter eight i would read through <SP2>
20701,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> all of eight point one like eight one a b c or whatever and then go back and take notes on the whole thing so like i knew like i didn't have to re read each paragraph <SP2>
20702,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> i kinda knew what was going on <SP2>
20703,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> okay <SP1>
20704,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> um but that took me like pretty much an hour for each like nine one nine two nine three nine four <SP2>
20705,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> really <SP1>
20706,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> like i sat in tisch from seven to eleven <SP2>
20707,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> damn <SP1>
20708,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> doing psych <SP2>
20709,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> that's that's tough <SP1>
20710,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> and it's like it's such a it's like not a waste of time but like i could have been i feel like there's got to be a better way to do it <SP2>
20711,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> see i don't take notes at all when i read cause i'll just get distracted by it like i'll be a so focused on the notes versus the reading <SP1>
20712,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20713,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> and i won't learn as much from it <SP1>
20714,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> uh huh <SP2>
20715,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> i like to just read through everything and then they have a little study guide things built into the text book <SP1>
20716,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20717,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> and i'll go back and do those after <SP1>
20718,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> just so i really master it <SP1>
20719,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> like the the quizzes <SP2>
20720,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> or the <SP2>
20721,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah like flash cards and the quizzes like go back and do those <SP1>
20722,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah maybe i'll try that for chapter ten <SP2>
20723,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20724,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> like i just feel like if i get through chapter nine i'll be fine cause ten is like the most recent thing we're learning <SP2>
20725,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20726,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20727,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> and then i'll just be able to like i can just review extra for it <SP2>
20728,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20729,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> for test on thursday <SP2>
20730,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> that works it's the balance that i just take like really like really effective notes in class <SP1>
20731,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20732,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> or i'll write down more than i necessarily need to <SP1>
20733,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20734,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> but just so i have it <SP1>
20735,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20736,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20737,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> i feel like <SP2>
20738,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> my class notes could be better but it's also like i i feel like i don't pay as much attention in class because i know i have the reading to fall back on <SP2>
20739,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> okay yeah <SP1>
20740,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> but like that's not good like i need to be paying attention in class but we'll see <SP2>
20741,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> i get that sometimes there are some there are some like lectures and chapters or at least part of a lecture i'm like okay i i i g i not really getting right now just like go refer to the reading <SP1>
20742,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20743,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> um and the sometimes where it's the opposite where i'll like i'll read it after like the lecture <SP1>
20744,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
20745,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> and be like uh the lecture made more sense than this this doesn't make as much sense anymore <SP1>
20746,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
20747,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20748,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> so but it is what it is i got <SP1>
20749,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20750,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> it's really just studying for exams and learning the material <SP1>
20751,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20752,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> exactly and like the i feel like this exam will be a little easier to study for <SP2>
20753,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> well not that we've seen the exam questions <SP1>
20754,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20755,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> from the first one we know how to do it <SP1>
20756,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yes and like it's not as much it's not as specific i feel like the material <SP2>
20757,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20758,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> it's more theories and like vague stuff <SP2>
20759,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> a little more vague <SP1>
20760,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> whereas like last time we had to know like all the different functions <SP2>
20761,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20762,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> and i was like lots of flash cards with that one <SP2>
20763,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> i spend so much time just making flashcards and then i found out they had like the flash cards built in <SP1>
20764,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> i know <SP2>
20765,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> and i was like really did i just spend like two days just making flashcards for no reason <SP1>
20766,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> that's all my friends did the same thing and i just like i ended up procrastinating studying for that until literally the night before like i took super diligent notes <SP2>
20767,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> which made it easier <SP2>
20768,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
20769,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> but i'm not doing that this time like i need to start studying tomorrow <SP2>
20770,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> you know i promised myself i'd do all the reading before all the lectures this time <SP1>
20771,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> uh i didn't cause i just finished chapter eight so <SP1>
20772,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah i finished chapter eight on thursday <SP2>
20773,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> i finished it <SP1>
20774,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> wednesday thursday <SP2>
20775,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yesterday so that was friday <SP1>
20776,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
20777,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20778,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> and chapter nine and ten are apparently really long <SP2>
20779,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> there's like five and six parts each <SP1>
20780,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> yeah and like the within the individual sections like they all scroll <SP2>
20781,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20782,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> for a really long time and i'm just like i can't do this <SP2>
20783,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP1> so much <SP1>
20784,2018-10-27-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,26,<SP2> do you ever watch the videos <SP2>

20834,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> e <SP2>
20835,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> at tufts <SP2>
20836,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> uh yeah he goes to tufts <SP1>
20837,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> oh okay <SP2>
20838,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah i think <SP1>
20839,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> do you wanna do abroad next year <SP2>
20840,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> um probably not just because i'm pre med and i just switched this year from econ <SP1>
20841,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> oh <SP2>
20842,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and psych to uh like bio psych <SP1>
20843,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay <SP2>
20844,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> so i have like a lot of um classes i need to catch up on <SP1>
20845,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> oh right <SP2>
20846,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and i'll probably be taking like five every semester for the rest of tufts <SP1>
20847,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> oh really <SP2>
20848,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> so i just don't feel like comfortable going abroad <SP1>
20849,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> right no that makes sense <SP2>
20850,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> which like cause like <SP1>
20851,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
20852,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah that makes sense <SP2>
20853,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> i don't really speak the language that well <SP1>
20854,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> cause that's gonna be tough <SP2>
20855,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> so you switch <SP2>
20856,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> what about you <SP1>
20857,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> so i'm doing um i probably wanna do it like at least a semester <SP2>
20858,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
20859,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um like i was thinking london would be a cool s like a good semester trip and then like it is tough cause i've been thinking about my classes and they're like lot of requirements throughout the four years <SP2>
20860,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
20861,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and i'm trying to kinda like plan it out in a way where like i can still do the abroad program and meet some requirements over there <SP2>
20862,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah for sure <SP1>
20863,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and then come back and like still not be completely behind um <SP2>
20864,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> but <SP2>
20865,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> are you a arts and sciences student <SP1>
20866,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah i'm an art and science student <SP2>
20867,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and like i'm doing the yeah the cognitive science major which is kinda it's it's definitely interesting um i'm worried about the computer science aspect <SP2>
20868,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> cool <SP1>
20869,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> really yeah like do you do you have to do three classes right <SP1>
20870,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah so you have to do like the intro comp then like data structures then you could like pick another one on like artificial intelligence or something <SP2>
20871,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
20872,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> at least you don't have to do comp forty <SP1>
20873,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>

21217,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> which made things a lot easier i'd say <SP2>
21218,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah for sure <SP1>
21219,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> now i just met someone yesterday um who's like talking about how like how they've had such a hard time with their roommate <SP2>
21220,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah i got randomly assigned a single my freshman year <SP1>
21221,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> oh a single <SP2>
21222,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21223,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> which was like which was like i i thought i was like kinda excited for it going into college <SP1>
21224,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay <SP2>
21225,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> i was like ah i don't have to worry about like having a roommate like what if i didn't like my roommate <SP1>
21226,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> but like i kinda already wanted to room with this um someone <SP1>
21227,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay <SP2>
21228,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> who like went to my high school who was also from tufts <SP1>
21229,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> oh really <SP2>
21230,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay <SP2>
21231,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> but he got like assigned a random roommate and i got assigned a single <SP1>
21232,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> so <SP1>
21233,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> so that would've been hard <SP2>
21234,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah so like <SP1>
21235,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> to switch <SP2>
21236,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah it was kind of already hard to switch but like we were just like so late too in the first place that i just kind of went with the single <SP1>
21237,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21238,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and like <SP1>
21239,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> it was <SP1>
21240,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> i can see advantages to singles are like now looking like now that i've been here i feel like singles aren't that bad at all <SP2>
21241,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah for sure <SP1>
21242,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> no they're really not <SP1>
21243,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21244,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> because like at least you have your own space <SP1>
21245,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> exactly <SP2>
21246,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> you get to decorate it however you want <SP1>
21247,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> exactly like studying is a lot easier <SP2>
21248,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and like <SP1>
21249,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21250,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> i'd say <SP2>
21251,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> for sure yeah i can't really study in my suite that's like the thing just because like it i went in with like nine other friends <SP1>
21252,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> right <SP2>
21253,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> so it's like ten of us who all know each other pretty well and like we're all pretty close <SP1>
21254,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay <SP2>
21255,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21256,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> but it's just like impossible to get work done <SP1>
21257,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> because like everybody's like someone's always like we have a tv set up <SP1>
21258,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> right <SP2>

21309,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> no that'll be awesome yeah <SP1>
21310,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah hopefully that'll like <SP2>
21311,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> compared to like <SP1>
21312,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> that we like we we got our group together yesterday in the library to like figure it out because like we're like oh god i we we do not know we're doing in this class and like <SP2>
21313,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> uh <SP1>
21314,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> dude group projects are always the hardest because you have to coordinate everyone <SP1>
21315,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21316,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> exactly like in high school it it was easy i feel like <SP2>
21317,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm well i feel like they <SP1>
21318,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> almost easier cause like in class like during school hours you could do it <SP2>
21319,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> exactly <SP1>
21320,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> it's cause like in s i feel like s like that's the difference between tufts and like my high school i feel like <SP1>
21321,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> mm <SP2>
21322,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> cause like high school you would show up in the morning and just be there until like four or whatever when you get let out <SP1>
21323,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> exactly <SP2>
21324,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and you have all that time like even if you didn't have like per like a class you had that like open period <SP1>
21325,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21326,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> to like be at school with school people <SP1>
21327,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> right <SP2>
21328,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21329,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> exactly <SP2>
21330,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> but at tufts when it's everyone in their free time like everyone's off doing their own thing <SP1>
21331,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> doing different things <SP2>
21332,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> exactly <SP2>
21333,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah it's so hard to coordinate people cause they're like i have this activity i have this thing <SP1>
21334,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21335,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> even even th it was like last night at like eight thirty it was like s it it took a while to schedule that it took like f four days <SP2>
21336,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah right <SP1>
21337,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> in advance to like <SP2>
21338,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and it's like <SP1>
21339,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> make sure we were all going to be there at the same time <SP2>
21340,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and it's like wednesday night like what are people really doing you know <SP1>

21357,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> i'm gonna have to take that <SP2>
21358,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay so i'm gonna have to take experimental <SP2>
21359,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> i'm doing the <SP2>
21360,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> well maybe not experimental i'm in um stats i think that's why i'm doing the sona stuff <SP1>
21361,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay <SP2>
21362,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21363,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mm <SP1>
21364,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah imma have to do that too i think i guess they'll just make me keep doing psych studies <SP2>
21365,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21366,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um but uh i'm i'm on my second unit so like fi there's like five chapters like it's like the human development one <SP2>
21367,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> oh that one's just that oh oh that was my favorite unit <SP1>
21368,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> really <SP2>
21369,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21370,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21371,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> i was thinking about picking up um like a human development and like child study minor <SP1>
21372,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> oh okay <SP2>
21373,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> just because i like i liked a lot of that like um developmental like psychology and philosophy <SP1>
21374,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21375,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> like so it was <SP1>
21376,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> it's definitely i think it's definitely more interesting the last unit for me <SP2>
21377,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah the last unit's the first unit's really technical right <SP1>
21378,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> but it's like <SP2>
21379,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> it's like oh like different parts of the brain <SP1>
21380,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21381,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21382,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and like shit like that <SP1>
21383,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah and i did i did i did well on the first test but i'm like i d di did your grades go up throughout the year <SP2>
21384,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> or like would you say like <SP2>
21385,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> um i think i started high went low and then ended high again <SP1>
21386,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay <SP2>
21387,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> because i got kinda cocky after the first test because i to i took like a lot of psych in high school <SP1>
21388,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay <SP2>
21389,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> i took like i took like um like one semester of psychology <SP1>
21390,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21391,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and then one semester of like neuroscience <SP1>
21392,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay yeah um i i mean like the after the first i felt the first pretty pretty easy if you had done the memorization <SP2>
21393,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah for sure <SP1>
21394,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and then this one is like it's again it's a lot of memorization <SP2>
21395,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm it's a lot of concepts i think <SP1>
21396,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21397,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah exactly it's like and like it's yeah exactly different theories and different like concepts that you have to grasp and then kinda just memorize and then just spit back out onto the test <SP2>
21398,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> right <SP1>
21399,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
21400,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> uh when they like bring it up which is you know it's an interesting test just sixty multiple choice <SP2>
21401,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
21402,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> but if you get one wrong it's like your grade drops <SP2>
21403,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> kinda <SP2>
21404,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> no for sure it's a lot like the bio exams are the same way it's like twenty five mulitple choice questions <SP1>
21405,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21406,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay yeah so if you get one wrong you're already down to like a ninety six <SP2>
21407,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> s <SP1>
21408,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah it's like yeah you're down like four points yeah <SP1>
21409,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21410,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> exactly it's kind of annoying <SP1>
21411,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> that is yeah <SP2>
21412,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> that's kinda <SP2>
21413,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
21414,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> but li are you so you're doing pre med so that's like physics and then as well as bio ch bio chem <SP2>
21415,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah i think i forget their requirements exactly but it's like a year bio a year of chem <SP1>
21416,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay <SP2>
21417,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> like introductory stuff <SP1>
21418,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21419,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> uh maybe like a semester of physics <SP1>
21420,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> um <SP1>
21421,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> org organic chem <SP2>
21422,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah orgo one orgo two or instead of orgo two you can do bio chem <SP1>
21423,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay <SP2>
21424,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> um <SP1>
21425,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and then it really it's actually like it's not as daunting as people think i think it's like although other than that it's just like two english classes <SP1>
21426,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> really <SP2>
21427,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and uh <SP1>
21428,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay <SP2>
21429,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> like some sort of statistics class <SP1>
21430,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> i think i placed out of the eng i did i yeah i placed out of the writing requirement at tufts <SP2>
21431,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> which is nice <SP2>
21432,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> oh you placed out of the yeah did you take the ap <SP1>
21433,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um i took the ap i took ap lang <SP2>
21434,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21435,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> in high school <SP2>
21436,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> that's awesome <SP1>
21437,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and i loved it so like i loved ap lang <SP2>
21438,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21439,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> so it's i i placed out of the writing require <SP2>
21440,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> but i'm actually still doing um <SP2>
21441,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> that's awesome <SP1>
21442,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> intro to philosophy which counts in english too <SP2>
21443,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> oh yeah it's english too <SP1>
21444,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um which doesn't really matter <SP2>
21445,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21446,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> but it's like i'm enjoying it it's it's not <SP2>
21447,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> who do you have <SP1>
21448,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> i d <SP2>
21449,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> for philosophy <SP1>
21450,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> i have ian blownstein <SP2>
21451,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> ian blowstein i've never heard <SP1>
21452,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> he's from em he's like an emerson teacher <SP2>
21453,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> oh <SP1>
21454,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> cool <SP1>
21455,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um <SP2>
21456,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> what's what's like what what are you reading like what philosophy books are you reading <SP1>
21457,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> so we're doing like a lot of different passages from different uh differentphilosophers <SP2>
21458,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> oh cool <SP1>
21459,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> like tons of different passages and right now we're talking about um we did the first two questions we wrote e we wrote essays on were like is it reasonable to fear your own death <SP2>
21460,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> which is kind of like whoa <SP2>
21461,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> damn <SP1>
21462,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah like existential shit <SP1>
21463,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay <SP2>
21464,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um and then um the other one was um <SP2>
21465,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> are we are we responsible are we ever like under what circumstances are we responsible for our actions and so i wrote about like um how there's no such thing as free will because like we're like products of our environment and our brains <SP2>
21466,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21467,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and we don't really have full control over either of those two things <SP2>
21468,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah for sure <SP1>
21469,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and so i'm like saying like yeah we don't really have full control over those so how can we have full control over our decisions um and then just said that we're not responsible ever which is like we'll see we'll see how i do <SP2>
21470,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> no that's i that's that's it's like it's a crazy like idea to wrap your head around <SP1>
21471,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah exactly <SP2>
21472,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> but like it's definitely like grounded in some reality <SP1>
21473,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> but like <SP1>
21474,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21475,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> like if you're just like if every person's like a blank slate or whatever like one of those things you talk about in psych one <SP1>
21476,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21477,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> right <SP2>
21478,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah tabula rasa <SP2>
21479,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> like yeah like tabula rasa yeah like <SP1>
21480,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah that's on my test tomorrow for sure <SP2>
21481,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21482,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21483,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> um didn't like really like have responsibility for put in such like bad situations <SP1>
21484,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> exactly <SP2>
21485,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> but also it makes me think of like like like social like in a social justice context like people who are like you know like born into like really destitute situations who commit crimes or whatever like extreme poverty it's like why does that person morally re reprehensible if they're just a product of their environment <SP1>
21486,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21487,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
21488,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
21489,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> right <SP2>
21490,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> exactly <SP2>
21491,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> mm <SP2>
21492,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> exactly and that's what i thought about as i was writing it was like yeah like if there there's not it's not like it's not like blind luck that there's a higher crime rate in those communities <SP2>
21493,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21494,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> it's not because it's not because of their like who they are <SP2>
21495,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21496,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> uh morally <SP2>
21497,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> for sure <SP1>
21498,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um and so like i'm like yeah the just system just seems kind of just some something society needs in order to function <SP2>
21499,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
21500,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> because without it we'd just be like just killing each other out there <SP2>
21501,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah there'd be we wouldn't be able to like we need to feel some sort of like <SP1>
21502,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and just <SP2>
21503,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21504,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> reperat like reparation i guess for like a bad <SP1>
21505,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> exactly <SP2>
21506,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> you wanna see things re repair made right <SP1>
21507,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21508,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21509,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> exactly so we have to s sign some sort of accountability to people <SP2>
21510,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
21511,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> which is you know i mean like it's it's definitely it's a tough concept to gra the whole class is kinda um is kinda crazy kinda trippy <SP2>
21512,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> no for sure <SP1>
21513,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> cause like it's you know we g we get into like just we like we'll read a passage and i'll go into class like thinking we're gonna talk about like the like a like the broad theme of it and we just get so into it <SP2>

21537,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> right <SP2>
21538,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> it's like creative writing <SP1>

21547,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and like everyone has their turn to have their story be the focus <SP1>
21548,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay <SP2>

21552,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21553,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21554,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and you have to like lead your own workshop and like when it's your story you have to like ask questions <SP1>
21555,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay <SP2>
21556,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and then do like a writing experience like i but i feel like it's really stressful sometimes when like everyone's just like staring at you around the circle <SP1>
21557,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah i feel that <SP2>
21558,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> it makes me like fear like like what a real meeting is like <SP1>
21559,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21560,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah that's true i mean i remember in high school i did my junior year when i did ap lang <SP2>
21561,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
21562,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> we did that we would have like and we would when we'd have a draft of our essays or even when we have our essays we'd go around and like not read the whole thing but like share what we talked about <SP2>
21563,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
21564,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and then we have like it'd just be open for like feedback slash criticism um and it was it's i always loved doing it because like i got really into the stuff i was writing about um and like that helped everything else in that class <SP2>
21565,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> like that i loved it only because like we got to pick what we wrote about <SP2>
21566,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> no <SP1>
21567,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> we got to choose what we wanted to write and so um i'd always pick s i'd always pick like controversial issues <SP2>
21568,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> hm <SP1>
21569,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and then i would um i would really just take different sides like on it like i wouldn't i would i would um i would never be like politically stable like on a certain like uh issue and i would try to like really like s fight for different arguments <SP2>
21570,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> prevent present both sides of it <SP1>
21571,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah and like and like fight for like and like f like really fight for both of them <SP2>
21572,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah for sure <SP1>
21573,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and then kinda at the end be like well here's the one that just has the facts and like that makes sense <SP2>
21574,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21575,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um <SP2>
21576,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> no that best i feel like i'm on the best like the best like paper is the one that opens up a discussion like that <SP1>
21577,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> that sort of presents both sides <SP1>
21578,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21579,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah exactly and it was just fun doing that like it it was it was i was getting more out of it i think because um i was getting different like perspectives on a lot of issues <SP2>
21580,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and then like <SP1>
21581,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
21582,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um and i felt like that was like and i think important thing i kind of want to take that the college i just make sure like um everyone hears each other um <SP2>
21583,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21584,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> because like that's important <SP2>
21585,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> that's true especially when yeah people don't always want to hear <SP1>
21586,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> that's like <SP2>
21587,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> right <SP2>
21588,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> especially when they have different opinions <SP1>
21589,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> people like yeah especially with you know like speech nowadays it's like people want to hear the speech that they agree with often times more than like they don't want to hear the speech that don't agree with <SP2>
21590,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> which is <SP2>
21591,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> for sure <SP1>
21592,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um which makes sense but then it's like you're missing a whole other asp like side to it and i think it strengthens your own beliefs like hearing the other side <SP2>
21593,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> for sure <SP1>
21594,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> like even if you hear like it even if it doesn't change your mind you might even be like more so like involved in what you had previously thought <SP2>
21595,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
21596,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> just because you're like well that really doesn't make sense <SP2>
21597,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah yeah i really disagree with like yeah <SP1>
21598,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and that's actually dangerous <SP2>
21599,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and like now i understand how you're thinking more <SP1>
21600,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah and like <SP2>
21601,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and likei can see why it's so dangerous <SP1>
21602,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> exactly and then maybe you could actually solve the issue better <SP2>
21603,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21604,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> if like if that's the case which i think is like i think that's an issue like across the entire country in terms like college campuses like everywhere <SP2>
21605,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
21606,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> where it's like people are very close minded no matter what side they're on <SP2>
21607,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah true <SP1>
21608,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um it's it's like a tough thing to solve <SP2>
21609,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> which is which is like i i haven't actually gone like really involved in any clubs here um which i would like to do are there is there did i miss a club fair i probably did <SP2>
21610,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
21611,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah there was a i mean there are club fairs like in the first few weeks <SP1>
21612,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21613,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> but there's one every semester <SP1>
21614,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21615,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> so like if you miss out this semester don't worry <SP1>
21616,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay <SP2>
21617,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> right yeah i me i was at the club fair but like it was like it was kind of it was kind of like <SP2>
21618,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> no it's like overwhelming <SP1>
21619,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> it was overwhelming <SP2>
21620,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and you have and likei remember at that point in the semester i had no clue like what activities i wanted to doing like <SP1>
21621,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> exactly i have no idea <SP2>

21626,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> where i was <SP1>
21627,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> exactly yeah exactly like i barely knew the campus at that point <SP2>
21628,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> basically it took me awhile <SP1>
21629,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
21630,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and it was it was kind of disorganized too like the way it was set up is was like just lines and lines of just tables and desks <SP2>
21631,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah and tons of people <SP1>
21632,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and people <SP2>
21633,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> it like seems like strangers yeah <SP1>
21634,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> exactly and you're just like why don't taekwondo club and like no <SP2>

21729,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>

21733,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21734,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> we we are sort of fighting for it back <SP1>
21735,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um <SP2>
21736,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> we actually moved into a d one league this year <SP1>
21737,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> oh really <SP2>
21738,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah out from d three so like we play with u conn and bc <SP1>
21739,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> okay <SP2>
21740,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21741,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> and northeastern <SP1>
21742,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> that's definitely yeah <SP2>
21743,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> um <SP1>
21744,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> for for tennis i we just had sectionals <SP2>
21745,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> oh shit <SP1>
21746,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and we played um like we were playing like d one teams which was like surprising we were like yeah we we played dartmouth we played brown we played uh b um bc yeah we played bc <SP2>
21747,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> but there's some like really really good tennis players <SP1>
21748,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> on some of those t <SP1>
21749,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21750,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> uh dartmouth had like an ex varsity player that just was just crazy good <SP2>
21751,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21752,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um and then we we played mit um and which was d three and then um a few other d three schools but we definitely had some d one schools in there that were like clearly d one but we actually we we beat we beat brown <SP2>
21753,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21754,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> oh awesome <SP1>
21755,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um <SP2>
21756,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and <SP2>
21757,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> wait sohow does how does how does it <SP1>
21758,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> how does it work for like so it's like individual competition for tennis but like i guess it's in a team setting <SP1>
21759,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> so yeah it's it's w it's interesting so it's like there we play one single one men's singles one girl singles one mixed doubles <SP2>
21760,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
21761,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> one men's doubles one women's doubles <SP2>
21762,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> oh then it's a <SP1>
21763,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> uh and out of five so you play five matches and you play to s and you play a set so to six <SP2>
21764,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21765,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um and then you add up your games so all the games you win <SP2>
21766,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> oh so yeah the games won <SP1>
21767,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and whoever has more games at the end continues <SP2>
21768,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> cool <SP1>
21769,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> that makes sense because it's like at least you're getting a like you're given like the full spread of like <SP1>
21770,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> which <SP2>
21771,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah it's it's d it's yeah you're given like the spread of this course like if you beat someone six three it actually matters if you beat them six three or six zero <SP2>
21772,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
21773,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> like those three could end up helping them which is it's not i'm not used to that cause like part of like some of my strategy could be to like um you know like give in to a game like play a long game and like even if you lose the game it's not a big deal because the next one is the one you were like planning for <SP2>
21774,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
21775,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> like to serve it out <SP2>
21776,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> the one that yeah like you were like like wait so is that a different format than like the high school format that you're used to <SP1>
21777,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah yeah high school um ma by match <SP2>
21778,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> so you you'd play three three singles four doubles matches so out of seven and best of seven so four f if you had four wins you win <SP2>
21779,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> oh <SP1>
21780,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> then you just win <SP1>
21781,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21782,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> okay so it's <SP1>
21783,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and then you move on <SP2>
21784,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> which <SP2>
21785,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah so there's a lot less pressure on each game basically <SP1>
21786,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> exactly yeah and i think there's all there is there is i was definitely not used to um the environment because like in high school sectionals was like that was huge like we had practice for like two months together we like worked hard and then we'd go off to sectionals and like it be like a big it'd be a big deal <SP2>
21787,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
21788,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um and like if we lost it'd be like we'd be like pretty devastated um and then here lot of pressure like people really wanted to move on <SP2>
21789,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> yeah i bet people really wanna win <SP1>
21790,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um it was weird because it was we had we had practice for like two or three weeks honestly before sectionals <SP2>
21791,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> oh wow <SP1>
21792,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> so it was like <SP2>
21793,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> so how long is your season <SP1>
21794,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um the season was like a month it's over now <SP2>
21795,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> really <SP1>
21796,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> so sectionals yeah that was the end <SP1>
21797,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
21798,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um sectionals was like the end of it we almost made to nationals we lost <SP2>
21799,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> uh crap <SP1>
21800,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> literally the last possible match by one game <SP2>
21801,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> good showing at least <SP1>
21802,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> um yeah against we loss against bc <SP2>
21803,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> against who who win <SP1>
21804,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> oh sh <SP1>
21805,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> and they went so like if we had one that we have would have gone to um orlando actually <SP2>
21806,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> oh that's sick <SP1>
21807,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> which would have been pretty cool <SP2>
21808,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP1> that would've been so much fun <SP1>
21809,2017-10-30-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,27,<SP2> yeah we would've gone to orlando for like nationals but um more i think about it the more i'm like i'm a freshman like going to orlando would be like that's that's a commitment <SP2>

22179,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
22180,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> cause like i feel like singing is just really easy <SP1>
22181,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP2> well you say that because you're good at it <SP2>
22182,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> and i <SP1>
22183,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP2> i want to sing <SP2>
22184,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> no <SP1>
22185,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> no but i feel like it's one of those re it's one of those things that's really easy to learn <SP1>
22186,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP2> that is my thing <SP2>
22187,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> you know like <SP1>
22188,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
22189,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> you practice a little bit and you get better at it <SP1>
22190,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
22191,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> dancing it like requires the th your th like thinking a lot <SP1>
22192,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
22193,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> and you have to think for singing too <SP1>
22194,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
22195,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> but you're just using your vocal cord whereas dancing you're using every part of your body <SP1>
22196,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP2> that is true <SP2>
22197,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> and it's also good work out <SP1>
22198,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP2> that is true <SP2>
22199,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP2> mm <SP2>
22200,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> but um i think that dancing is way more complicated and way more interesting and just like you have to i don't know you have to think about it more i think <SP1>
22201,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
22202,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> which is <SP1>
22203,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP2> cause there's more things you have to move <SP2>
22204,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> i don't know <SP1>
22205,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP2> and to think about and it only takes until like your you have to overcome like i guess like a hump <SP2>
22206,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
22207,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP2> like i you're learning blah blah blah and then you get well so you don't have to think about it <SP2>
22208,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
22209,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
22210,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP2> but i think it's easier for thinging singing <SP2>
22211,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
22212,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP2> like you're saying yeah <SP2>
22213,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
22214,2018-10-27-session-3b_nogaps_step1_GPT,28,<SP1> that's why i say h people here are so talented like with music <SP1>

22739,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> okay <SP1>
22740,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> stuff like that so it's not really like <SP2>

22754,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> a lot of work man <SP2>
22755,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> and like the midterms are annoying cause like you have to hand like you're writing an essay and then like he has you do the these short id things which is like writing like <SP2>
22756,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
22757,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> basically mini essays so you have a intro like a paragraph about the the bulk of the content and then like conclusion just talking about the significance yeah it's a long man like he gives you so you have a start time and you can and end kinda whenever you want so like the last the first mid term i like was there for like three hours <SP2>
22758,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> what the fuck <SP1>

22923,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> you so you basically have a week then you're gone <SP2>
22924,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
22925,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> dang <SP2>
22926,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah i have to like get back like pack like you know figure out what i need <SP1>
22927,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah you basically have to pack as soon as you get back <SP2>
22928,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah like pa like unpack and then pack again like right away <SP1>
22929,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
22930,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> so <SP1>
22931,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> dang <SP2>
22932,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
22933,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> we'll see i do you think it's gonna be harder than tufts like i feel like it it shouldn't be <SP1>
22934,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> are you gonna what's the university university of london or <SP2>
22935,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah it's like one of the campuses for university of london <SP1>
22936,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> i feel like <SP2>
22937,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> what classes are you taking <SP2>
22938,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> so i'm taking biochem that's like the only difficult class <SP1>
22939,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> oh i think yeah <SP2>
22940,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> and then like three other like cl like arts classes or like like london it's museums like architecture in london like <SP1>
22941,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> classes that like are easy <SP1>
22942,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> i think that you'll be fine <SP2>
22943,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> you'll be i think like the only cla yeah biochem that's about <SP2>
22944,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
22945,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah i'm like gonna devote most of my time to that <SP1>
22946,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
22947,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> um yeah plus the way uh classes work there it's like different cause it's mostly just like studying on your own and then at the end of the semester there's like a big exam that's worth the majority of your grade so like for biochem the final's like seventy five percent so like it's like very different than here <SP1>
22948,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yo yeah i think so my girlfriend took biochem uh last year <SP2>
22949,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> and like for at tufts like with the bio bio chem like they break it i don't know if it'll apply for this upcoming semester but like he like basically like scaled like your exams <SP2>
22950,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
22951,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> by and by scaling like say like you did like bad on like or like you didn't do as well on that <SP2>
22952,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> okay so he weighed the one that you did well on <SP1>
22953,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah he weighed the one you did well on <SP2>
22954,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> more <SP1>
22955,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> like the highest percentage yeah <SP2>
22956,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> okay <SP1>
22957,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
22958,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> which is like i i like that <SP2>
22959,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah actually a lot of like engineering classes and some math classes do that like i've heard <SP1>
22960,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
22961,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> so yeah that's that's pretty good <SP1>
22962,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> did you ever consider engineering <SP2>
22963,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> um i did so in the beginning i was thinking of doing cs and pre med at the same time it's not like exactly engineering but it's like kind of in that field <SP1>
22964,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> mhm yeah nah it's similar <SP2>
22965,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> uh but i quickly realize like it's gonna take up so much time like my gpa is probably gonna be a lot lower than if i major in something like slightly easier <SP1>
22966,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
22967,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> i mean like yeah the plus is that like if i decide to not like do pre med them like i can get like a great job <SP1>
22968,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> you can do a great job out of comp sci <SP2>
22969,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> but <SP1>
22970,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
22971,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah but i decided that like i'll just go all in with like pre med <SP1>
22972,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> and then like <SP1>
22973,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
22974,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> kind of i think that's like the best way to do it <SP1>
22975,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> nah <SP2>
22976,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> cause i don't want to like sit on like t two places at once <SP1>
22977,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> exactly <SP2>
22978,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> and then at the end like kind of be like in the middle somewhere <SP1>
22979,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> exactly <SP2>
22980,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
22981,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> you know <SP1>
22982,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> cause like i had a friend who he was pre med as well uh and comp sci <SP2>
22983,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
22984,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> and he was kind of doing that and then like yeah it didn't work out <SP2>
22985,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> oh really <SP1>
22986,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah he end up dropping pre med cause yeah he's like it's not like it's hard to do tha i think especially the comp sci <SP2>
22987,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
22988,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> and pre med theres so so much s such time consuming classes <SP2>
22989,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> because it's so much time <SP1>
22990,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
22991,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> that <SP2>
22992,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
22993,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah like i see a lot of my housemates like struggling like with their like cs assignments <SP1>
22994,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
22995,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> like <SP1>
22996,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> bro that's <SP2>
22997,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> i don't know i can't can't do that <SP1>
22998,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> y but you you have coding experience though like from cause you've taken the comp sci courses you need for cbs right <SP2>
22999,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah most of them i need like one more <SP1>
23000,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> you need one more <SP2>
23001,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> senior year <SP1>
23002,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah i was like doing like pretty well like comp eleven i did really well <SP1>
23003,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> like comp fifteen like i was like on par with like and all my friends like doing just as well <SP1>
23004,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
23005,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> really <SP2>
23006,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> so like if i did it i probably could've done it <SP1>
23007,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> you would've been good in comp sci <SP2>
23008,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
23009,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> but like also what i didn't like was like when i was doing an assignment like i would think about that assignment like twenty four seven until i finished it it would like consume my mind so like i really like didn't like that <SP1>
23010,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> i'm like i want to stop thinking about that <SP1>
23011,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> i feel like you're still like that <SP2>
23012,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> but i don't want that <SP1>
23013,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> i i feel like you're still like that though <SP2>
23014,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> really <SP1>
23015,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> i don't know <SP1>
23016,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> it doesn't like <SP1>
23017,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> not not probably not to as high a degree with comp sci cause i feel like comp sci's a little more time consuming <SP2>
23018,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> with assignments <SP2>
23019,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> cause like you're constantly thinking of like how to solve the the problem <SP1>
23020,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah you're definitely not thinking about psych stats assignments <SP2>
23021,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> eh nah dude fuck that <SP1>
23022,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> um <SP1>
23023,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
23024,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah no but i try to like you know take it easy like on the weekends and like <SP1>
23025,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
23026,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> chill out like not like <SP1>
23027,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah you sleep in today <SP2>
23028,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> stress too much yeah yeah i went to bed at like three <SP1>
23029,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> damn <SP2>
23030,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> so i slept till like eleven <SP1>
23031,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> oh yeah cause you were playing poker <SP2>
23032,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah dude <SP1>
23033,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> how was it though <SP2>
23034,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> it was really fun so <SP1>
23035,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
23036,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> so uh we went over to um my suitemates from last year they have a house on whitman i think <SP1>
23037,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> i don't know where that is <SP2>
23038,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> so yeah but we went over <SP1>
23039,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> but <SP2>
23040,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> okay <SP2>
23041,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> we had like seven people <SP1>
23042,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> playing the th <SP1>
23043,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> oh that's nice <SP2>
23044,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
23045,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> you had a little squad <SP2>
23046,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah so it started with six and then this girl came over who's like a mutual friend <SP1>
23047,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
23048,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> i felt kinda bad cause she wanted to play but like she didn't really know what she was doing at all so like yeah she would like put in a ton of money and then like when it came to like showdown like she didn't really have like anything almost so like she would just take her money <SP1>
23049,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
23050,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> um so she got out pretty quick and then two other guys got out and it was like four of us um for like two hours probably cause <SP1>
23051,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> damn <SP2>
23052,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> so we played like two hours initially then another two hours with four people and the last hand that we played um it was like a really interesting hand and i got the um m i got the straight like on the last card on the river <SP1>
23053,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
23054,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> so i like took all his chips cause he went all in and like i just like doubled up basically <SP1>
23055,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> dang <SP2>
23056,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> so i ended up with the biggest stack <SP1>
23057,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> nice man <SP2>
23058,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> so <SP1>
23059,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yes it's very satisfying very satisfying <SP1>
23060,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> so very satisfying <SP1>
23061,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> oh mi mike low key a poker player <SP2>
23062,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> very satis <SP1>
23063,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> okay <SP2>
23064,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> bro yeah i've played a couple times in a casino like <SP1>
23065,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> really <SP2>
23066,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
23067,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> i used to play online a lot <SP1>
23068,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> oh <SP2>
23069,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> so um i know what i'm doing a bit <SP1>
23070,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
23071,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> a bit <SP1>
23072,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> so yeah <SP1>
23073,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> dang that's dope that's dope <SP2>
23074,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah no it's a lot of fun if you ever want to play <SP1>
23075,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> like <SP1>
23076,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah so i don't really know how to play poker so <SP2>
23077,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
23078,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> but first i gotta start with like learning the rules <SP2>

23201,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> so sharewood's cool um <SP2>
23202,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> do you go every tuesday how is that <SP1>
23203,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> nah so like how it works well like so i started like this past summer <SP2>
23204,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
23205,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> and like how it works like during the academic year since there's a little more people they usually take like four or five volunteers <SP2>
23206,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
23207,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> like to the clinic like every tuesday so like since there's so many it's like kind of like a rotation <SP2>
23208,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
23209,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> so like during the semester it's more like once a month <SP2>
23210,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> oh okay <SP1>
23211,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> but like during the summer it's a little more frequent like every other week so <SP2>
23212,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> interesting <SP1>
23213,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> depends yeah <SP2>
23214,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
23215,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> how did you get in like did you know somebody or did you like volunteer for their committees before <SP1>
23216,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> but it's <SP2>
23217,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> uh i don't so <SP2>
23218,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> or did you just like get lucky <SP1>
23219,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> i didn't volunteer high key i feel like what helped my case was the fact there was a summer session which is less competitive <SP2>
23220,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
23221,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
23222,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> so i <SP2>
23223,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah no that definitely <SP1>
23224,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> i applied like for the summer session well i'd been like trying to get in like all like second year but like obviously didn't work out <SP2>
23225,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
23226,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> so i applied summer session and then like yeah i got in um <SP2>
23227,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> nice <SP1>
23228,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> but then like i i i did like a good job i guess <SP2>
23229,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> oh nice nice yeah <SP1>
23230,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> as a volunteer <SP2>

23236,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
23237,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
23238,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
23239,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> just cause it's like it's kinda it's like once a month but like the timing's sometimes weird like it'll it may happen a week where you're slammed <SP2>
23240,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> cause it's like four hours at at time right <SP1>
23241,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> or is it <SP1>
23242,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
23243,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
23244,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> so like <SP2>
23245,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> that's like kinda like a chunk <SP1>
23246,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> that you gotta like reserve <SP1>
23247,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> it's a chunk of your day and like it's like one of like it's like the time period where like i like to do like most of my work at like five to nine <SP2>
23248,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
23249,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
23250,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> like i like to do like work during that time <SP2>
23251,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> so like <SP2>
23252,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah you can get screwed if it's on an exam week or some shit <SP1>
23253,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah and like i've gotten i've come <SP2>
23254,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> like <SP1>
23255,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> and it's once a month <SP1>
23256,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> so you can't really say like oh like i can't go <SP1>
23257,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah and like <SP2>
23258,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> bro like with orgo like you know how orgo is like every week it seems like every week is like some kind of an assessment <SP2>
23259,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> cause like <SP1>
23260,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
23261,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> n uh i'm pretty sure like literally every week <SP1>
23262,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> like every week is an assessment so like it'll like fall like tuesday night like a lot of the quizzes some of the exams have fallen on wednesday for me so like literally the next day i have like <SP2>
23263,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
23264,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> but i'm like with other classes sometimes it's conflicted in the fact that like i think one of the times i had um sharewood i had like a french exam the next day <SP2>
23265,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> like at eight in the morning <SP2>
23266,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
23267,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> so it was like literally after four hours of volunteering <SP2>
23268,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> that's really annoying <SP1>
23269,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> i had to study so it's been a grind but next semester i'm thinking of taking the semester off just cause like my courseload's a lot more <SP2>
23270,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
23271,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> i wanna devote more time to that and i like might be doing a different research position <SP2>
23272,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> oh really <SP1>
23273,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> um <SP2>
23274,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> but i have like i have a final interview monday so after that i'll know if i get it <SP2>
23275,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> like for credit or paid or like how would that like <SP1>
23276,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> but <SP2>
23277,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> this is just kind of experience <SP2>
23278,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> so like it's at you know beth israel <SP2>
23279,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> y yeah deaconess <SP1>

23366,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
23367,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> so yeah it's like pretty pretty useful <SP1>
23368,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> no i and like i started doing i think this has been the first semester i've done this just cause like yeah <SP2>
23369,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> most of my classe okay so if i get like the i told you about um the autism class <SP2>
23370,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> so like <SP2>
23371,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> aw yeah like um it was like bio like <SP1>
23372,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> no it's a psych actually bro <SP2>
23373,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> y it's a psych but isn't it like focused on like the um the like pathol or like something about autism that's related to bi biology <SP1>
23374,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah like neuro neuro dev like the <SP2>
23375,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> n neurobiology of autism right or something <SP1>
23376,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah so it's a l it's it's a lot but bro the fa so like i talked to people who had taken the class <SP2>
23377,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
23378,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> okay so you want the the grade breakdown's weird and i don't know like how like uh i guess i'll like get a better sense if i get this class how like they grade it but y okay so the class is two and a half hours once a week <SP2>
23379,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
23380,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> like there's like one period for that <SP2>
23381,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
23382,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> and like your grades are based on you have to lead <SP2>
23383,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> a class one of the one of the days like that full two and a half hours <SP2>
23384,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> the fuck that's that's mad work <SP1>
23385,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> that's what i'm saying that's what i'm saying <SP2>
23386,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> that's mad work <SP1>
23387,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> like how do you do that for so i don't know how <SP2>
23388,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> maybe it's a group no <SP1>
23389,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> mm <SP1>
23390,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> i feel like so the class is the class is the class is twenty people <SP2>
23391,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> like it's at least gotta be like two or three of you like leading the class <SP1>
23392,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> bro it's gotta be at least like two people <SP2>
23393,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> oh okay <SP1>
23394,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
23395,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> like <SP2>
23396,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> cause there's not enough classes <SP1>
23397,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> to lead a class discussion <SP2>
23398,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> like <SP1>
23399,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> there's probably more <SP1>
23400,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> and i but like <SP2>
23401,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> but <SP1>
23402,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> if like not as many people sign up for the class yo it might be looking a little trash where i'll just be by my by myself leading it <SP2>
23403,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> so yeah you have to lead a two and a half hour like uh discussion on like certain like papers <SP2>
23404,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> okay <SP1>
23405,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> on autism neurodevel and then like you have two papers so there's a midterm paper seven pages and the final paper is twelve pages but the final paper is building off of your midterm <SP2>
23406,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah it sounds like a like a classic like seminar class <SP1>
23407,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
23408,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> where like mostly you discuss like research papers <SP1>
23409,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> so it's basically a seminar <SP2>
23410,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
23411,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> and like kind of focus around that like n new developments <SP1>

23418,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> um we have like three quizzes that are based on papers uh then we have like participation's like worth a lot so we talk about it and then we have like a presentation that needs to be like basically the whole class so like <SP1>
23419,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
23420,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> an hour and fifteen and then there's like a final paper based off of the presentation <SP1>
23421,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> oh yeah <SP2>
23422,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> so <SP1>
23423,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> so similar classes <SP2>
23424,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> yeah it's really like similar concept <SP1>
23425,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
23426,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> so like i so far in that cla it hasn't been too bad right <SP2>
23427,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> no it's honestly not that much work <SP1>
23428,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
23429,2018-11-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,29,<SP1> like there's like a paper a week <SP1>

23539,2017-10-30-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,30,<SP2> and he does is like living out like in europe and traveling and doing like <SP2>
23540,2017-10-30-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,30,<SP2> stuff that he's not like it's like government sanctioned but like there's no record of it because it's like the bad stuff side and like what the government doesn't want people to know <SP2>
23541,2017-10-30-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,30,<SP1> ah <SP1>
23542,2017-10-30-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,30,<SP2> and it's stuff like that and then there's like the villain and he uh he's from i think saudi arabia and like when he was it starts like when he's a kid and like he sees his like father be like beheaded for speaking out against like politics or whatever and then just like how that shaped his life and then he like starts to <SP2>
23543,2017-10-30-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,30,<SP2> like he tries to like figure out how to um take down america cause that's like what's backing saudi arabia's like government so he like creates this <SP2>
23544,2017-10-30-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,30,<SP2> thing of like this virus of like small pox but like a hundred times more deadly because smallpox doesn't have a cure <SP2>

23548,2017-10-30-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,30,<SP1> but it seems to me like like cause he's trying to like save all americ americans why doesn't the government want people to know about his like actions <SP1>
23549,2017-10-30-session-2_nogaps_step1_GPT,30,<SP2> well because it's like they don't want anyone to know that what like the small pox because people will like go crazy yes <SP2>

24184,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> inexpensive like you you just like don't ha like you know i mean like a huge house might be like this big <SP2>
24185,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24186,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> so it's like that might cost like a hundred dollars to make <SP2>
24187,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> you know what i'm saying <SP2>
24188,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> no not at all <SP1>
24189,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> okay so it's kind of like <SP2>
24190,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> oh ah ah wait this is a g this is a good way to think about it <SP2>
24191,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> is this like an alternate world <SP1>
24192,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> no it's like no it's like this company has figured out how to like shrink people down <SP2>
24193,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> oh sh like physically shrink <SP1>
24194,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24195,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> oh so it's like literal downsizing <SP1>
24196,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> oh yeah <SP2>
24197,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> i thought you meant like getting fired <SP1>
24198,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> oh <SP2>
24199,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> no like they're like literally they're just like smaller <SP2>
24200,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> oh they're small okay <SP1>
24201,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24202,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> and therefore like their money buys more <SP2>
24203,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> more yeah <SP1>
24204,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24205,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> that's so that's that's interesting actually <SP1>
24206,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> no it it that sounded really the the trailer was good too <SP2>
24207,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> they're smaller so they don't yeah they don't need as much food they need a smaller house <SP1>
24208,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> exactly yeah <SP2>
24209,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> um <SP1>
24210,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> no yeah i think the one example they use in the trailer was like <SP2>
24211,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> they bought like a bottle of champagne and it lasted them like five years or something because they were just so big and they're not that big <SP2>
24212,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24213,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> which is kind of funny <SP2>
24214,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> get drunk off a little sip <SP1>
24215,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> this is a new movie <SP1>
24216,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> came out like i don't know <SP2>
24217,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> oh it came out already <SP1>
24218,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> maybe like a month ago <SP2>
24219,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24220,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> i thought over winter break i wanna go see and never did <SP2>
24221,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> been there <SP1>
24222,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah du i i think movies are so weird now it's like so many people don't go but like i was talking to like <SP2>
24223,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah i know i just watch them on netflix <SP1>
24224,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah people just watch them but like i was talking to <SP2>
24225,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> talking to my dad about this actually there's like this new company that like <SP2>
24226,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> uh huh <SP1>
24227,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> you pay like it's like a ten dollars subscription or something and you can go to a you can go to like unlimited movies per month <SP2>
24228,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> at participating theatres <SP2>
24229,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> interesting <SP1>
24230,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> which is like kind of crazy cause like one movie ticket <SP2>
24231,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24232,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> is probably like ten bucks <SP2>
24233,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> you pay ten dollars a month <SP1>
24234,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah it's why it's insane <SP2>
24235,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> are they just hope <SP1>
24236,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> i didn't really understand it either <SP2>
24237,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> i don't understand that model <SP1>
24238,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> how i don't get how they make money <SP2>
24239,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah i know <SP1>
24240,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> doesn't make any sense <SP2>
24241,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> do like unless they have like agreements with the <SP1>
24242,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> um <SP1>
24243,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> like i can see how that might work like in bulk <SP2>
24244,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> well yeah if you have enough people doing it yeah but <SP1>
24245,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> if you <SP1>
24246,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> like maybe if they had agreements with like each of the individual movie theaters like they get some kind of a cause like the people are gonna go and probably buy snacks and stuff too if they're getting the movies for free <SP1>
24247,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> oh true <SP2>
24248,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> oh and you know it's like maybe it's also like i have it like i have the subscription and i want to go to the movie <SP2>
24249,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24250,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> but maybe like my girlfriend doesn't or like my friend doesn't so when we go like they still have to pay <SP2>
24251,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah or like you get <SP1>
24252,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> but if you got like a like they give you like a card and you like show it every time you go in and they like keep track of how many people are um and like the movie theater keeps track of like each everyone who shows like the card what this like that says you have this subscription and then um <SP1>
24253,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24254,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> and then basically you get <SP1>
24255,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> a little like i guess commission off each person who uses i don't know <SP1>
24256,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24257,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> i don't know i just thought it was interesting <SP2>
24258,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> because it's like <SP2>
24259,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah i know that <SP1>
24260,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> i don't know they're trying to like get people to go to movies again <SP2>
24261,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> people are lazy though <SP2>
24262,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> i know i still don't think i would go that often <SP1>
24263,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> no like like i would say like <SP2>
24264,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> i think for it it's like a really good like date thing it's like going to the like <SP2>

24345,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> no i definitely feel the same way <SP2>
24346,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> um <SP1>
24347,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> but yeah no so it's so it's going well i think that's that hasn't really been a problem i kinda want to do the assignment this weekend <SP1>
24348,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> um <SP2>
24349,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
24350,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> assignment one to get it out of the way <SP1>
24351,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> it does not look very difficult <SP2>
24352,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> it doesn't you just need to find two articles and so i just need to spend the time to do that <SP1>
24353,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
24354,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> um <SP1>
24355,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> comp sci has been like <SP1>
24356,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> comp eleven yeah <SP2>
24357,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24358,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> has been <SP1>
24359,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> do you like it or <SP2>
24360,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah i like it it it feels so good to like finally get your program working <SP1>
24361,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> finish your code <SP2>
24362,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24363,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
24364,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> like after just struggling through it and like getting getting back syntax errors and um <SP1>
24365,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> like oh and just or just like having it not work at all <SP1>
24366,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24367,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> kinda like having to figure out why um but <SP1>
24368,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> i feel like i'd like that class <SP2>
24369,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> it <SP1>
24370,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> i yeah i think you would it definitely it definitely takes time <SP1>
24371,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24372,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah i like that <SP1>
24373,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> like it's definitely like it's <SP2>
24374,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> definitely a week's worth of work <SP1>
24375,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> cause like you get assig like the way it works is you get assigned homework on thursday <SP1>
24376,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24377,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
24378,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> and then basically you have ne till next thursday to do it all <SP1>
24379,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> um so <SP1>
24380,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> h how do you guys have like midterms and stuff in that <SP2>
24381,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> i don't know i'm kind of scared because like coding takes me a while and if we have to do like coding in class <SP1>
24382,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> mm there's no i don't really don't think they make you do that <SP2>
24383,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> i hope not i don't know i i i'll have to ask henry see what they did <SP1>
24384,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> he's a he's a comp sci major right <SP2>
24385,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah he's in comp fifteen right now <SP1>
24386,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> i heard that's fucking difficult <SP2>
24387,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24388,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> i'm sure <SP1>
24389,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah i wanted to take i actually wanted to take comp eleven this semester <SP2>
24390,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24391,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> i decided to take calc three instead i'll just take it cause i didn't want to take both <SP2>
24392,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah that's probably a smart move <SP1>
24393,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> um <SP2>
24394,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah so i'll take it probably in the fall <SP2>
24395,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah i w wanted to take comp ten just cause it was like it's like comp eleven except not for majors <SP1>
24396,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
24397,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> like comp sci majors so it's like a lot more easy going <SP1>
24398,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24399,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> but i l i literally showed up for the class the first week back and <SP1>
24400,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> like i get there and there are the class is just absolutely packed <SP1>
24401,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24402,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> like everyone on the waitlist showed up <SP1>
24403,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24404,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> um so we were like twenty people over capacity <SP1>
24405,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> geez how big is the class <SP2>
24406,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> not that big i think it was only supposed to hold like thirty thirty five people <SP1>
24407,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> mhm yeah <SP2>
24408,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> mm but there ended up being like fifty people there <SP1>
24409,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> damn <SP2>
24410,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> um <SP1>
24411,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> e <SP1>
24412,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> s but like i was looking around and i'm pretty sure i was the only freshman in that room <SP1>
24413,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24414,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> um <SP1>
24415,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> and so yeah he like at the end of class he was like gonna try and like um find a bigger room so like he could accommodate all the people that wanted to take the class which is cool but then like he got an email from people saying like no we can't give you a bigger room you need to just say no <SP1>
24416,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> they needed to cap the classes <SP2>
24417,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24418,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> that makes sense <SP2>
24419,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> unfortunately <SP1>
24420,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> but you know i how do you like the guy i heard he's a little bit of a character <SP2>
24421,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> which one <SP1>
24422,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> the comp sci guy <SP2>
24423,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> uh oh the professor <SP1>
24424,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24425,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah he <SP1>
24426,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah he's <SP1>
24427,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> definitely interesting <SP1>
24428,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> he <SP1>
24429,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> i don't know it's like hard to describe him he's <SP1>
24430,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> he's definitely he's very smart <SP1>
24431,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
24432,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> that's for sure um and <SP1>
24433,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> he's like <SP1>
24434,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> his sense of humor is kind of like um <SP1>
24435,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> it's so hard to explain <SP1>
24436,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24437,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> it's kind of like a computer in a way he um <SP1>
24438,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> where like cause like computer science like you have to have each step laid out <SP1>
24439,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
24440,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> um and so it <SP1>
24441,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> that's what is jokes are like <SP2>
24442,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah kind of so he um <SP1>
24443,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> and he's like he always like says like oh cannot process because blank is <SP1>
24444,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> i don't know it's hard <SP1>
24445,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> what what does he like go through code in class or <SP2>
24446,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> n uh ki it's more of like the concept so like how to make how to do repetition um and like how to make the code do the same thing over and over for like an x amount of times um um so it's more like bigger concepts like that <SP1>
24447,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
24448,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> last class which was helpful he like kinda went through how the computer thought about where like you have you basically have your code and then <SP1>
24449,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> your or yeah you have your code and then <SP1>
24450,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> a lot of what coding is is functions which is like code inside of it's like <SP1>
24451,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> a string it's a s it's a string with like code inside of it so if you call the function than the code that's inside the function will run and you'll get like a <SP1>
24452,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> a c c <SP2>
24453,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> oh <SP2>
24454,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> so like x squared for example <SP1>
24455,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> sure <SP2>
24456,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> like that's that would be like a he had the square function or whatever <SP1>
24457,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
24458,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> if you like name your function like square and then wrote inside it how to like how exactly one would go about squaring a number that's inputted <SP1>
24459,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24460,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> then um basically when you call a function and it'll run well it'll ask you to like input a number and then a like run the code and it'll um give you a number back and so he like basically talked about how the computer will <SP1>
24461,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> kind of for each action within the um within the code inside the function it'll like um so if you wanted it to print hi or whatever it would like create an activation record <SP1>
24462,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
24463,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> for print <SP1>
24464,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24465,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> and then it will like it like analyze what it wants to print so it'll be like okay it wants me to print hi i can do that <SP1>
24466,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> okay <SP2>
24467,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> it'll send that back <SP1>
24468,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> it's pretty cool <SP2>
24469,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> it'll print that and then the activation record will go away and <SP1>
24470,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> it <SP1>
24471,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> i don't know it that especially just kinda helped me like wrap my head around um <SP1>
24472,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> like what the computer is actually doing or we're doing <SP1>
24473,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah it's definitely it's definitely a really cool field like my dad like <SP2>
24474,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> um was like no like i'm helping pay for your like college education this is the one class you need to take <SP2>
24475,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24476,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> which is c like comp eleven <SP2>
24477,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> i mean that's fair <SP1>
24478,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> um <SP2>
24479,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> i'd say that's fair <SP1>
24480,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> no no no and i like wanna take it anyway <SP2>
24481,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24482,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> like he i think he was like kind of joking but <SP2>
24483,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> my dad thinks it yeah thinks the same way it thinks it should all <SP1>
24484,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> um <SP1>
24485,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> just at least like for everybody to like understand like even though like even though comp eleven is just like the basics right it's c plus plus <SP2>
24486,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24487,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> oh well we're doing python and c plus plus <SP1>
24488,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> okay <SP2>
24489,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> but like so like just like now like you since you're able to code in both of those it like enables you to do jobs were like which are like eighty percent co eighty eighty percent noncoding <SP2>
24490,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24491,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> but like twenty percent coding <SP2>
24492,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah apparently after <SP1>
24493,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> comp eleven and comp fifteen we're at like an employable level of <SP1>
24494,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> really <SP2>
24495,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> that's that's what someone told me i don't know <SP1>
24496,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> that's pretty cool <SP2>
24497,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> if it's true <SP1>
24498,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24499,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> you think you're gonna keep going or no <SP2>
24500,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> uh depen we'll see how the rest of the semester goes <SP1>
24501,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24502,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> we'll figure it out from here <SP1>
24503,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> definitely <SP2>
24504,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> so i'm taking this intro to finance class with uh <SP2>
24505,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> this my professor's name is david driscoll <SP2>
24506,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> he's like this guy who's never taught before he's a tufts alum <SP2>
24507,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> um and he worked in finance for like i don't know thirty years or whatever <SP2>
24508,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> and now he's teaching us <SP2>
24509,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24510,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> he's such a character it's hilarious <SP2>
24511,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> he's ma he's like really funny <SP2>
24512,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> <SP1>
24513,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> really probably that's good <SP1>
24514,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah he's he's also he's actually like a good teacher <SP2>
24515,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> is he a good teacher <SP1>
24516,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> like <SP2>
24517,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> feel like a lot of those people are like don't really know how to tea like you know like it's like knowing the information doesn't enable you to teach the information <SP2>
24518,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> that's true <SP1>
24519,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> right it's like <SP2>
24520,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> how well you convey it to people who don't know <SP1>
24521,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> exactly and it's like using like techniques <SP2>
24522,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> to try and like i don't know <SP2>
24523,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24524,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> like like j yeah exactly like just like demonstrate it in a way that makes sense to people um <SP2>
24525,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24526,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> but yeah he's he's doing a good job it's actually it's rea it's a really interesting class <SP2>
24527,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> what do you guys what do you guys do what do you learn about <SP1>
24528,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> so like we started off with like talking about present and future value of money <SP2>
24529,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> okay <SP1>
24530,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> um so is that that part has been pretty like equation heavy <SP2>
24531,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> equations yeah <SP1>
24532,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> so it's been like you know <SP2>
24533,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> f v equals p v times the rate <SP2>
24534,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24535,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> to like <SP2>
24536,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> r t or whatever <SP1>
24537,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> to n or something yeah or <SP2>
24538,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24539,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> to p n which is like periods <SP2>
24540,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24541,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> and <SP2>
24542,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> n is years <SP2>
24543,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24544,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> which is like it's interesting <SP2>
24545,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> it's the classic equation <SP1>
24546,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> exactly yeah so like we started off with that <SP2>
24547,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> bless you <SP1>
24548,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> um so we started off with that we did uh <SP2>
24549,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> we star then we did like we're doing more with cash we did more of with class cash flows <SP2>
24550,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24551,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> so like <SP2>
24552,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> um like figuring out <SP2>
24553,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> kind of like how to compare investments based on your cash flow <SP2>
24554,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> which is pretty interesting that's a more equations basically <SP2>
24555,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
24556,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> um <SP2>
24557,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> now or we just finished <SP2>
24558,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> this thing called n p v and i r r which is like <SP2>
24559,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> n p v is net present value <SP2>
24560,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24561,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> and i r is <SP2>
24562,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> something rate of return investment return <SP2>
24563,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> is <SP1>
24564,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> probably <SP2>
24565,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> um and so that's like that helps with like evaluating investments it's pretty interesting <SP2>
24566,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> interesting <SP1>
24567,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> um <SP2>
24568,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> yeah like it we're moving onto bonds now which i think would be really cool we talked about like bond pricing um and like just the bond markets <SP2>
24569,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> is it a lot of work for intro to finance <SP1>
24570,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> let's see we've had the first problem set was like the easiest thing i've ever done <SP2>
24571,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> you've only had one then <SP1>
24572,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> no we had two and we have like a third one due on tuesday <SP2>
24573,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP1> are they like hard <SP1>
24574,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> the second one was difficult like <SP2>
24575,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> i <SP2>
24576,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<SP2> like the first half was really easy and then the second half was like <SP2>
24577,2018-02-10-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,31,<END>
24578,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<START>

24668,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24669,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> you know <SP2>
24670,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i'm not on a team but like i play casually but i played in high school um yeah <SP1>
24671,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i watch youtube videos <SP1>
24672,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yeah we all do that <SP2>
24673,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> wait squash is like a just a paddle and a black rubber ball is that what it is <SP2>
24674,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> um it's like racquetball except like the ball is smaller it's like tennis inside like inside a room <SP1>
24675,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> what made you get into the ra um squash <SP2>
24676,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> um my parents just signed me up for it when i was a kid you know like it's really fun i think it's a lot more from than like <SP1>
24677,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> then tennis <SP2>
24678,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> tennis cause tennis you have to like walk around and pick up the ball every time <SP1>
24679,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> that's true you have to run a lot as well <SP2>
24680,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24681,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i mean re squash is like a lot of short movements it's like <SP1>
24682,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> you hit like the room isn't that big so you can run from corner to corner <SP1>
24683,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> mm <SP2>
24684,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24685,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> how do you like what's like i i'm not familiar with like the how it works like the the matches and like the scoring or like points <SP2>
24686,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> it it's it's like ping pong score right it's goes to eleven win by two um imagine it's like tennis except like you hit it against the wall <SP1>
24687,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> wait wait how do you get like score a point against your opponent cause you're both in the same room right <SP2>
24688,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> if it bounces twice <SP1>
24689,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> so bounces twice okay <SP2>
24690,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah so like imagine you're like playing tennis except like both sides of the court are like mirrored on one side <SP1>
24691,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> mm <SP2>
24692,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> so like you hit the ball against the wall like imagine that's like going across the court and then it bounces off and then your opponent has to hit it back onto the wall <SP1>
24693,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> when you hit it though you have to like step aside for your opponent to c <SP2>
24694,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> well yeah there's like enough room you do you don't want to hit it to yourself otherwise you'll get like a point off <SP1>
24695,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> aye <SP2>
24696,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> do you that means you can also can you guys like add spins to your shots or like <SP2>
24697,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24698,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> okay <SP2>
24699,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i mean and you can hit it off the side walls and the back wall <SP1>
24700,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> and like there's like ba lines to make sure which which parts of the wall are out <SP1>
24701,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> oh okay that makes sense seven okay <SP2>
24702,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24703,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> sounds like fun <SP2>
24704,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> it is fun <SP1>
24705,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> and played it do we have a squash court here <SP2>
24706,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> we have like three they're really they're really bad i don't know if i can curse <SP1>
24707,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> wait where are they <SP2>
24708,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> they're like they're on the top floor of the gym jackson gym <SP1>
24709,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> oh okay <SP2>
24710,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> so they need like they're so bad that the squash team doesn't even practice there they go to harvard <SP1>
24711,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> wait that's so sad <SP2>
24712,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i know it's pretty sad <SP1>
24713,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> what <SP2>
24714,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> our squash team is is good that's why i'm not on the team i couldn't <SP1>
24715,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> are they good <SP2>
24716,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24717,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> are they like on <SP2>
24718,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i mean they're not like good i mean they're good like in comparison to other schools but like in nescac is like the best um <SP1>
24719,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> like division for squash <SP1>
24720,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> wait is it <SP2>
24721,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> is is our squash d three or s or d one or something <SP2>
24722,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> um i'm not sure <SP1>
24723,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> fair <SP2>
24724,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i don't know <SP1>
24725,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i mean i'm not on the team <SP1>
24726,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> fair enough <SP2>
24727,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> it's reasonable <SP2>
24728,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> are you ready for the uh psych stats test next week <SP2>
24729,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> oh yeah you wanna like teach me because i don't <SP1>
24730,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> no i i am actually missed like two lectures <SP2>
24731,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i haven't been paying attention for weeks like i haven't paid attention to it since the last exam <SP1>
24732,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> i missed two lectures dude i'm like dying <SP2>
24733,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> uh i have to like i think i have to read i'm gonna read the entire like hundred pages of the textbook this weekend <SP1>
24734,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> was it more helpful to read a textbook or just <SP2>
24735,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> the textbook is like really helpful for me i mean i haven't like the the the little bit that i've read is like very helpful cause i thought the first exam was pretty easy <SP1>
24736,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
24737,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> and then like this one i don't know any of the contents so i have to learn it <SP1>
24738,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> like i wasn't the last basically everything on the slides <SP2>
24739,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah but the last one was like <SP1>
24740,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> in a sense <SP2>
24741,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i mean the slides i don't think are very hopeful i don't find them helpful <SP1>
24742,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> alright fair enough so y i generally i'm too lazy to read so i i usually hope on the slides <SP2>
24743,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah same <SP1>
24744,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> usually i don't but i like i think the slides this for this um content are like not helpful <SP1>
24745,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> that makes sense i think yeah <SP2>
24746,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> cause i look at them and i'm like what is going on <SP1>
24747,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> oh yeah that's true cause he explains most of it in the lecture <SP2>
24748,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah i mean there are recordings i think on trunk of his l lectures but like i think i'm just gonna try reading it cause the the textbook is like like w it's written in a way that like helps you out cause like the author's like i know this is hard like i know this confusing but like let me explain it like a certain way <SP1>
24749,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> mm makes sense yeah seems like this this time around it's more computational which is annoying <SP2>
24750,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i like seriously don't know anything like i i go through lab and like i didn't sit with someone and they like tell me honestly answer <SP1>
24751,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yeah i went w that's my lab basically too the like <SP2>
24752,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> wait i i i i feel like you might be in my lab <SP1>
24753,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> do you have julia <SP2>
24754,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> are you <SP1>
24755,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24756,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> uh b <SP1>
24757,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yeah we are in the same lab <SP2>
24758,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24759,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i think she's a she's like a co researcher for this uh <SP1>
24760,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yeah i saw her name on here too <SP2>
24761,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> test <SP1>
24762,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24763,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yeah it's strange i didn't realize you're my lab <SP2>
24764,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>

24768,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yeah i that that lab was bad i d i didn't look at the lectures <SP2>
24769,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24770,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> and like <SP2>
24771,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i don't fee i feel like she's not i mean <SP1>

24826,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> this always happens <SP1>
24827,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> um <SP1>
24828,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> music theory music theory <SP1>
24829,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> music theory <SP2>
24830,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24831,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> linguistics and music theory <SP2>
24832,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> is there a ken jao in your class <SP2>

24834,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> in either linguistics or music theory <SP2>
24835,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> linguistics i don't know anybody cause i don't go to class <SP1>
24836,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i mean it's it's like <SP1>
24837,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i say that stat like the stuff that we learn is like pretty like esoteric and like not useful but like linguistics is like on a whole nother level of useless <SP1>
24838,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> oh <SP2>
24839,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> it's <SP2>
24840,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> and like it's if you ever wanted to know what like the the bilabial valer like tract of your like tongue is then like take linguistics otherwise do not <SP1>
24841,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> what what is that <SP2>
24842,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> it's like it's in i thought it was gonna be cool like if you learn like the different parts of like language and meaning and stuff like that but like a lot of it is just like random information that you like <SP1>
24843,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> wait it's just the intro <SP2>
24844,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24845,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> okay okay <SP2>
24846,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> but like it's way more like the not theory based but like memorizing like names of parts of like speech and stuff <SP1>
24847,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> mm that's fair <SP2>
24848,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> than i was expecting <SP1>
24849,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> would you feel like maybe if you went to like a higher like level linguistics it'd be m more interesting <SP2>
24850,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i mean <SP1>
24851,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> probably <SP2>
24852,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i don't know cause if this is intro then like <SP1>
24853,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> cause i feel like more m <SP2>
24854,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> you have to build on those <SP1>
24855,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> cause i feel like most intro classes are like very general or like broadish <SP2>
24856,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah exactly that's why it's like really specific <SP1>
24857,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> so it's like kind of boring <SP2>
24858,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> s oh <SP2>
24859,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i i'd like it's if it was general i think i would enjoy it more actually <SP1>
24860,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> oh okay oh it's not general oh okay <SP2>
24861,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> no <SP1>
24862,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> nevermind then <SP2>
24863,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24864,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i mean it it's required for cbs majors <SP1>
24865,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yeah i've hard my friend's also cbs how's comp sci eleven treating you <SP2>
24866,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> uh did i mention that i hate my life i hate my classes um it's like it's it's not bad honestly i i'm doing pretty well so <SP1>
24867,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> it's just all the homeworks take forever <SP1>
24868,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yeah i heard that too <SP2>
24869,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24870,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> it's hellish <SP2>
24871,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> as long as i make through comp fifteen if i can't make it through then then i have to like totally change everything <SP1>
24872,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> oh my god <SP2>
24873,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> my life cause comp fifteen and i'm like worried cause after that you ta you take that you take like one hundred level course in comp sci and then like you don't have to take anymore for cbs <SP1>
24874,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24875,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> well damn <SP2>

24885,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> that's good <SP2>
24886,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24887,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> that's good <SP2>
24888,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> and if i don't if i decide to like if i can't handle comp fifteen i could just minor and you don't need to take comp fifteen <SP1>
24889,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> holy shit <SP2>
24890,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> huh <SP1>
24891,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> wait w what made you want to be a cbs major <SP2>
24892,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> um i mean i thought about psychology but then like i kind of wanted to like diversify you know <SP1>
24893,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> so <SP1>
24894,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah basically and comp sci's like pretty interesting i like it <SP1>
24895,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yeah it's pretty interesting <SP2>
24896,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> and i'm thinking about like pre law stuff so <SP1>
24897,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> pre law <SP2>
24898,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24899,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> there isn't a pre law cour <SP2>
24900,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> no no <SP2>
24901,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> there's like i took um <SP1>
24902,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> doesn't that mean you just have to prepare for like the the bar and everything <SP2>
24903,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24904,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> on your own <SP2>
24905,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> and the lsat yeah um i took sociology of law <SP1>
24906,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> and there's like a couple like random law classes there's like philosophy of law <SP1>
24907,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> and then like business law <SP1>
24908,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> and stuff <SP1>
24909,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> a lot of law <SP2>
24910,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i haven't taken the like you l apparently like you don't really have to take law related stuff before you go to law school which is like kinda worrisome cause like i don't know if i really like it until i go to law school and like if i go to law school and i don't like it then like what do you do <SP1>
24911,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> that's true <SP2>
24912,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24913,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> lawyers <SP2>
24914,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> lawyers <SP1>
24915,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> cbs is supposed to be a good like pre major if you're or major undergraduate major if you're looking for law stuff <SP1>
24916,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> wait why why is it so <SP2>
24917,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> cause just like psychology and then like you have to take logic and stuff <SP1>
24918,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> oh <SP2>
24919,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> for cbs so <SP1>
24920,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> okay <SP2>
24921,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> you're like that <SP1>
24922,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> although i'm like <SP1>
24923,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> debating about like the importance cause like law school like gpa and your lsat score are like the number one most important things so like i'm not sure if i should like switch out of cbs to like an easier major so that i can have a high gpa cause there's like cause the apparently like law schools don't care like what's where what your what you did in undergrad as long as your grades are high <SP1>
24924,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> like there's like they they'd rather take like a four point oh in like film and media studies over like a three point four in like engineering or something <SP1>
24925,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> that's <SP2>
24926,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> that's odd why is that <SP2>
24927,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> cause like i mean i think it's just like the schools like want want the higher rankings from like their a their average gpa is high so they get more money you know <SP1>
24928,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> wow <SP2>
24929,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24930,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> that's <SP2>
24931,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> it's like i'd say i think it's like i it's nice cause it's not as like subjective as like choosing a undergraduate college cause like it's just like pure like gpa and lsat but like kinda sucks <SP1>
24932,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> that's true favor the easier hm <SP2>
24933,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24934,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> what is med med school like what's the process i don't know anything i have like one doctor friend <SP1>
24935,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> well <SP2>
24936,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> do you know <SP1>
24937,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> um i should probably should research into more of it i know that starting from next year should prepare for the <SP2>
24938,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> well i should technically i should ish prepare like right kinda like slight prepare right now for the mcat <SP2>
24939,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> and then you you take the fucking test and then you apply it to a bunch of schools and hope you get in <SP2>
24940,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah i mean i had like an existential crisis while i was studying comp for my exam i had an exam yesterday i was like instead of studying i was like looking up like law school statistics <SP1>
24941,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> and stuff like i was like what do i do with my life <SP1>
24942,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24943,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> no don't do that <SP2>
24944,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yeah look up the stats for getting into med school i'm like yeah i'm scared <SP2>
24945,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24946,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> um yeah <SP1>
24947,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> some rough careers <SP1>
24948,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24949,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> it's worrying <SP2>
24950,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> how long you reckon it's been already <SP2>
24951,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> oh yeah i don't even know what time is it <SP1>
24952,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> the walk here was really long <SP2>
24953,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah and i i d i went to the wrong place <SP1>
24954,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yes same i thought it'd be <SP2>
24955,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> in the psych building <SP1>
24956,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> closer <SP2>
24957,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> but i guess the set up isn't in the psych building <SP1>
24958,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yeah this is too legit <SP2>
24959,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> it's two forty two <SP1>
24960,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> so when did we get here you got here at like two twenty <SP1>
24961,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> mm <SP2>
24962,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> so like <SP1>
24963,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> that's fair <SP2>
24964,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> been like fifteen twenty minutes <SP1>
24965,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> what an engaging conversation <SP1>
24966,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> i know right totally <SP2>
24967,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> wait w what's the purpose of u with them recording to us again i forgot <SP2>
24968,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> they're like gonna analyze our like social uh cues and like gestures and ga like i don't know <SP1>
24969,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> oh like our body language and what we do <SP2>

24972,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> cause i don't think <SP1>
24973,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i mean i guess they are they don't they do care about the content of the conversation but <SP1>
24974,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> it's mostly like social i took social psych freshman year so like <SP1>
24975,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i feel like i should know more <SP1>
24976,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
24977,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> but i don't <SP1>
24978,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> i heard social psych was pretty fun actually <SP2>
24979,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah it's really fun it's probably my favorite class that i've taken at tufts <SP1>
24980,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> cause the professor was awesome <SP1>
24981,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> mm b <SP2>
24982,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yeah my roommate said it was pretty awesome cause like uh didn't they have you take like in class like social experiments or something <SP2>
24983,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> we did some yeah <SP1>
24984,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yeah it sounds pretty fun <SP2>
24985,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> but like the content was just really great in the textbook was fun to read also <SP1>
24986,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> nice <SP2>
24987,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
24988,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> and it was like so easy and like so easy <SP1>
24989,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> huh <SP2>
24990,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i didn't uh i mean i did go to class because it was fun honestly <SP1>
24991,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> but like it's pretty easy <SP1>
24992,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> that's pretty nice <SP2>
24993,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> um <SP1>
24994,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> have you finished your like distribution requirements <SP1>
24995,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> for just school or like <SP2>
24996,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah just like school <SP1>
24997,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i mean have you finished like h h how far along are you <SP1>
24998,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> what do we need english that's writing that's done <SP2>
24999,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> um yeah <SP1>
25000,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> and then like <SP2>
25001,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> and then world civ <SP1>
25002,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> what counts as a world civ again do culture classes count <SP2>
25003,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
25004,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> i like get those i think i get those done like mm soon ish <SP2>
25005,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> cause i think they also count for like towards your language right if you take like four courses of a language and then two courses of a culture <SP2>
25006,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah i think i i mean i kinda screwed up cause i thought i would be jun done with chinese last semester but like i i apparently they don't count like together i took like i took chinese cinema freshman year <SP1>
25007,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
25008,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> and then chinese one and two and i thought that was it cause i took french i'd passed out of three semesters of french so that would been six total semesters but like apparently you have to get to at least chinese three before <SP1>
25009,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> cause you need like three semesters of two languages to pass out <SP1>
25010,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> oh <SP2>
25011,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> but then like now i can use the chinese cinema as my world civ so i'm done with that <SP1>
25012,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> but and after world civ there's natural sciences <SP2>
25013,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> which i <SP2>
25014,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> probably don't need to worry about <SP2>
25015,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
25016,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
25017,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> cause i took like f jesus christ <SP2>
25018,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
25019,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> you're gonna take like fifty <SP1>
25020,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> and then <SP1>
25021,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> and like social sciences humanities and arts <SP1>
25022,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> what counts as a social science again <SP2>
25023,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> i don't remember <SP2>
25024,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> it's like psychology sociology <SP1>
25025,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> oh yep that's definitely done soon <SP2>
25026,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
25027,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> arts <SP2>
25028,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> and math there's math also <SP1>
25029,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> oh fuck man that's sta don't doesn't stats counts as math <SP2>
25030,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i think this counts as math yeah <SP1>
25031,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yeah t this counts <SP2>
25032,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> well this i mean our the class that we're both in <SP1>
25033,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
25034,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> art classes <SP2>
25035,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> oh <SP1>
25036,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> alright i t i'm considering taking psychology of music i think it counts as both like a psych class <SP2>
25037,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> yeah i think i might take that next semester <SP1>
25038,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> it it doesn't count as psych and as a art class <SP2>
25039,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> i think so <SP1>
25040,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> oh yeah <SP2>
25041,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> and like i'm thinking about minoring in music <SP1>
25042,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP2> minoring in music <SP2>
25043,2017-11-03-session-4_nogaps_step1_GPT,32,<SP1> like a very <SP1>

25439,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> oh because it's a fifth class <SP1>
25440,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> depending on my other commitments or whatever and how cause literally the only reason i'm taking it's like for interest it's not like fulfilling anything for me i'm pretty sure it's not an art credit so <SP2>
25441,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> oh what else are you taking <SP1>
25442,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> all my classes are this is what wait did i tell you about my whole crisis that like maybe i'm stupid <SP2>
25443,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> no <SP1>
25444,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> of like all the classes i take or what everyone else considers like easy classes <SP2>
25445,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> no but you're in one that linguistics that you're like this is fairly hard <SP1>
25446,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> yeah but like i feel like in general like people consider all the class that i take is like bullshit classes because they're like humanities or whatever <SP2>
25447,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> that means nothing <SP1>
25448,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> anyway um <SP2>
25449,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> most engineers might be able to take a humanities class and like most engineers say that a humanities class is actually really hard <SP1>
25450,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> okay <SP2>
25451,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> like they're looking for the easy one <SP1>
25452,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> yeah i mean i don't know <SP2>
25453,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> quote end quote <SP1>
25454,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> i feel like some people were in the classroom other like oh this is so whatever but anyway <SP2>
25455,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> yeah i'm in like creative writing a philosophy class called nothingness <SP2>
25456,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> which is like super out there <SP2>
25457,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> right right <SP1>
25458,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
25459,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> right with darren <SP2>
25460,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> actually me and darren had so much fun <SP2>
25461,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> that dinner was fun yeah <SP1>
25462,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> wait we actually had so much fun in that class after we were literally like um he like did all these drawings in my no cause they were having like technical difficulties with playing like the m videos and stuff so we were just like chilling and so he was like drawing all these weird drawing in my notebook and we were like writing like weird poetry in our notebooks and like writing notes and stuff it's actually really fun <SP2>
25463,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> that's fun <SP1>
25464,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> um but yeah what was i saying okay yeah nothingness creative writing <SP2>
25465,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> now i'm in this film class stats and this linguistics <SP2>
25466,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> they sound that's a lot <SP1>
25467,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> i just like suddenly got really insecure about like <SP2>
25468,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> in yeah <SP1>
25469,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> because you know last year i was like oh like you know getting to college i was like oh no it's gonna be like hard to do well and i was like oh i'm actually doing well but now i'm re like oh okay i'm doing well but it's in these like classes that people considerable bullshit <SP2>
25470,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> mm <SP1>
25471,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> and like when i'm actually taking a class like romance linguistics i'm like i have no idea what's going on <SP2>
25472,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> cause they're hard <SP1>
25473,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
25474,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> but i've realized i need to just like study for that class i can't just do the readings i have to like go back and know it <SP2>
25475,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> that's annoying <SP1>
25476,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> cause you live through it like you have to know like the tongue like position when you say like ul or whatever and like <SP2>
25477,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> yeah they but i remember we had a a person come in to cbs last year <SP1>
25478,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> so many like technical <SP2>
25479,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> and try teaching that stuff and i was like what <SP1>
25480,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> i don't <SP1>
25481,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> in cbs <SP2>
25482,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> cognitive brain science yeah <SP1>
25483,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> uh huh <SP2>
25484,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> stats is actually seemingly okay it just is fine <SP1>
25485,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> everyone said it was gonna be really easy but then someone i talked to said like it's not as easy as everyone says like they said towards the end it gets hard <SP2>
25486,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> yeah it'll probably get harder cause stats does get harder but right now it's like been fine <SP1>
25487,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> yeah but also another thing was like in that la <SP2>
25488,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> i can't <SP1>
25489,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> and everyone else had already finished like people finished like two hours before me <SP2>
25490,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> mine lasted two <SP1>
25491,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> no mine lasted two and a half hours we couldn't just lea <SP1>

25493,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> no we didn't get the instructions for anything <SP1>
25494,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> she was just supposed to be like reading out and teaching us how to do excel graphs and she just like wasn't <SP1>
25495,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> wait you didn't get the instruction sheet <SP2>
25496,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> no <SP1>

25502,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> yeah cause we didn't have any of the instructions and know what to do <SP1>
25503,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> o <SP2>

25668,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> but that's theoretically i would get it in senior year to <SP1>
25669,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> do you wanna do not <SP2>
25670,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> i if i'll have to live in it see how i feel if it's a nice place i'm sure i'll be fine <SP1>

25672,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> i won't really want to have to move again if i don't have to make my parents do it um cause i have a lot of stuff <SP1>
25673,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> the thing was like well this is just compared to bella's house but like i felt like bella's house felt a lot more like open and that was like a little felt a little like tight <SP2>
25674,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> yeah no i i agree <SP1>
25675,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> and it was also like in it's also much better location <SP2>
25676,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> although i do it for me for me it's in a good location like for my life <SP1>
25677,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> for ginn <SP2>
25678,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> yeah for ginn and then just like in middle life <SP1>
25679,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP2> yeah well i mean her house is closer to ginn probably <SP2>
25680,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> just like flat <SP1>
25681,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> but <SP1>
25682,2018-02-05-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,33,<SP1> we'll see i also wouldn't want to have to deal with it all again but <SP1>

26468,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
26469,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> i'll forget and i was in bedford new bedford new hampshire <SP2>
26470,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
26471,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> and at my i knew my two friends i lived really close to each other i like thought i knew the way because i was driving from one graduation party to the other and i took a wrong turn and i thought it we were literally like in the middle of nowhere like i was convinced that we were in like a neighborhood area and then i think what's it called <SP2>
26472,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> new boston road where the speed limits like fifty but people drive sixty and at the stop sign was literally in the woods and i missed it and i just like went into like oncoming traffic and i hit someone's back en and then he spun out but like in they literally though like i <SP2>
26473,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> had nothing like i literally never saw the other car so i went to a four hour practice the next day <SP2>
26474,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> like i didn't even feel sore cause i never saw that car <SP2>
26475,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> but i completely totaled like totaled my dad's car and <SP2>
26476,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP1> wait i'm so confused what wait what is having being sore have to do with it <SP1>
26477,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> because usually when you get car accidents like you subconsciously get like tense <SP2>
26478,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> even if like it like happens like this like your body just like naturally like whatever but like s i had s that like s is how genuinely i never saw the other car and like <SP2>
26479,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> it was wild <SP2>
26480,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP1> oh was the guy okay <SP1>
26481,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> yeah he was a he was fine i i think he i'm not really sure it was such a blur i thought i killed him i was crying i had nightmares for months after it <SP2>
26482,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> um well it was the first car accident in the past decade that no one died <SP2>
26483,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> so that was scary <SP2>
26484,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP1> what do you mean <SP1>
26485,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> because people go sixty on it <SP2>
26486,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP1> oh the first ticket on that i mean the first accident on that road <SP1>
26487,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> and that intersection <SP2>
26488,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> well that intersection specifically <SP2>
26489,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> because that st i don't know what's wrong with that intersection <SP2>
26490,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP1> why don't they just fix the intersection so people stop crashing <SP1>
26491,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> i don't know but so i didn't even get a ticket i like cause they're just like yeah <SP2>
26492,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP1> saso happy that everyone w fine <SP1>
26493,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> well that and then also just like it's a really bad intersection and what else well like worst case scenario well there are two things that could have happened one is i pulled out an oncoming car could have come <SP2>
26494,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP1> yeah i've heard of that happening <SP1>
26495,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> and like hit me in the door <SP2>
26496,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> that would've been t that would've been <SP2>
26497,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP1> especially if the car came onto your driver's side <SP1>
26498,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> no right cause like it was like this like this his road oncoming me <SP2>
26499,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP1> hm <SP1>
26500,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> so if i pulled out like <SP2>
26501,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP1> then the people would have come <SP1>
26502,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> boom i would have died and then also if it was like half a second sooner i would have hit him in his door but i was going like twenty five miles an hour like i was not going remotely fast i was also lost so i was driving really slow and then if i had also gone half a second later i would have completely cleared the intersection so then it's just like one of those like things and i would just always been like oh my god like thats so scary and like never talk about it ever again but <SP2>
26503,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
26504,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP1> well that's scary <SP1>
26505,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> yeah it was terrible and then what else i've just gotten in like baby accidents that i haven't even been driving like one time my dad and i were sitting at a stop light and it was like my first day of school at like my like original like catholic high school and some guy just like literally like rammed into us <SP2>
26506,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP1> wait oh you repeated <SP1>
26507,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> and then <SP2>
26508,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
26509,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP1> but you're kinda young <SP1>
26510,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> yeah and then he like drove away and we were just like okay <SP2>
26511,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP1> okay bye <SP1>
26512,2018-02-03-session-6_nogaps_step1_GPT,34,<SP2> and oh my gosh my sister was such a bad driver in the beginning she literally was just like driving so slow that she like tapped the car that was the only thing yeah the car the car we're like we went to pull over to like talk and see if damage and like the guy just drove away and we were like okay <SP2>

27015,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> they're like well if a dog has rabies it'll die like a few weeks after <SP2>
27016,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> and rabies can show up anytime up to nine weeks <SP2>
27017,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27018,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> and if you don't get vaccinated for rabies and you get it you almost certainly die <SP2>
27019,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> oh my <SP1>
27020,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> so i'm like i'll just get the shot how much is it she's like it was something crazy like twelve thousand dollars <SP2>
27021,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> noah <SP1>
27022,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> and i didn't get it <SP2>
27023,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> noah <SP1>
27024,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> but every every week i would call and be like como esta su perro you know <SP2>
27025,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> oh <SP1>
27026,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> and i i don't have rabies <SP2>
27027,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> but that was scary <SP2>
27028,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> long story short <SP1>
27029,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> but she said i don't think you have rabies like also it like wasn't deep enough that like you should be worried <SP2>
27030,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27031,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> and you're on like crazy drugs <SP2>
27032,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> and you flushed it out <SP2>
27033,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27034,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27035,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> but she the woman in the clinic was telling me that a woman <SP2>
27036,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> can't believe it bit you <SP1>
27037,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> a woman was in there earlier the monkeys you know like the capuchin monkeys <SP2>
27038,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> yeah yeah yeah yeah <SP1>
27039,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> the like you know <SP2>
27040,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> yeah yeah yeah <SP1>
27041,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> they're kind of scary <SP2>

27045,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> and they're really fast <SP2>
27046,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> oh <SP1>
27047,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> so once we were in this like little outcropping <SP2>
27048,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> of the rainforest <SP2>
27049,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27050,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> and there was a table and we were eating watermelon and cookies and stuff <SP2>
27051,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> yeah <SP1>

27053,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> and a kid was like near some trees and he was holding a piece of watermelon <SP2>
27054,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> no <SP1>
27055,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> a monkey came pushed his hands through the watermelon fell out grabbed it in midair and went on <SP2>
27056,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> me <SP1>
27057,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
27058,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> that's so funny <SP1>
27059,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> but <SP2>
27060,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> they're really aggressive and they're not like if y ou give them food they'll like take it <SP2>
27061,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27062,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> yeah <SP1>

27064,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27065,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> and they most definitely always have rabies <SP2>
27066,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> have rabies <SP1>
27067,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> like they always carry it <SP2>
27068,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> oh my god <SP1>
27069,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> so this woman was in the clinic and she had tried <SP2>
27070,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> i didn't see her but the woman who was tending to me told me that had tried to give the capuchin monkeys some watermelon <SP2>
27071,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> and it like jumped on her and just like <SP2>
27072,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> no <SP1>
27073,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> bit the shit out of her <SP2>
27074,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> poor thing <SP1>
27075,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> and she had to get a rabies shot for sure because she most definitely have contracted rabies from the monkey <SP2>
27076,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> oh my gosh that sucks that's <SP1>

27105,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27106,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> because it's called a ferdelance and it's the most venomous snake in all of south america <SP2>
27107,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> that's crazy <SP1>

27125,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> clicks tongue <SP2>
27126,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> right <SP1>
27127,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> and <SP2>
27128,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> it was just there <SP2>
27129,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> b <SP1>
27130,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> what did you do just walk away <SP1>
27131,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> uh i had a panic attack <SP2>

27143,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> and i'm like <SP2>
27144,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> is continuing with this hike like worth the risk of possibly dying <SP2>
27145,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> dying <SP1>
27146,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> like probably not <SP2>
27147,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> probably not <SP1>
27148,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> and i started c i was like <SP2>
27149,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP1> no yeah i would've one the same thing <SP1>
27150,2018-10-27-session-1b_nogaps_step1_GPT,35,<SP2> like <SP2>

27260,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> emma watson <SP2>
27261,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> emma watson has done a better job breaking out <SP1>

27266,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> maybe that's why <SP2>
27267,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> and broadway <SP1>
27268,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> or maybe he just enjoys doing that better <SP2>

27272,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> although i feel like it's easier for like female actors to like get <SP2>
27273,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> more roles i guess <SP2>
27274,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> maybe <SP1>
27275,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i don't know <SP2>
27276,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> maybe it's because all female roles are so similar to each other <SP1>
27277,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> that's true don't have to be that diverse <SP2>
27278,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27279,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> what happened to ron's actor like <SP2>

27498,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i mean i guess there's not a lot you can do in the long run <SP2>
27499,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> the thing is like a zombie like people living in the zombie apocalypse would not have survived for as long as a season has been going <SP1>
27500,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> like i'm impressed that there's still that many people in like the the human world <SP2>
27501,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah <SP1>

27507,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> the premise yeah <SP1>
27508,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
27509,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> they have like a baby <SP1>

27512,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> during that i'm like how <SP1>
27513,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> like honestly though like cause like it's like the mother dies like how you're going to feed the baby then <SP2>
27514,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> oh true i didn't think about that <SP1>
27515,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> c and also like babies are loud like how did those monsters like not kill a all of them <SP2>
27516,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> that's the thing <SP1>
27517,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> that that is the <SP1>
27518,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> that is the problem in the movie <SP1>
27519,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> is like how do you keep a baby during this <SP1>
27520,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> like e <SP2>

27524,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> cause like yeah it's so loud you have to like <SP1>
27525,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> carry it everywhere <SP1>
27526,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i know i know i feel like i'm like i feel like to me like post apo apocalyptic plots are like the most interesting <SP2>
27527,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> cause like i'm always like interested in oh like how <SP2>
27528,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> mm <SP1>
27529,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> all society's gonna fall apart or like how people are gonna like recover <SP2>
27530,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> that's so dark <SP1>
27531,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i know but i'm i feel like they usually make for like really good premises and like <SP2>
27532,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> like simulations kind of <SP1>
27533,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> yeah like movies or like video games <SP2>
27534,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
27535,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> but like i feel like um <SP2>
27536,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> doesn't like carry out like that i don't know i for me i don't really like reading like reading about it <SP2>
27537,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> oh <SP1>

27548,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
27549,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> movie looks pretty good but i tried to read the book and i was like i can't get past this <SP1>
27550,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> what is it what is it about <SP2>
27551,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> um basically like the world is like it's like one of the i think it's one of those things where it's like oh the city is a safe place <SP1>
27552,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
27553,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> but like once you leave the city it's like there's a lot of stuff going on <SP1>
27554,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
27555,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> but basically it's like <SP1>
27556,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> it's almost like like weeds like these plants and stuff like <SP1>
27557,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> like all the organisms are like like altered and like weird and like distorted <SP1>
27558,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> what <SP2>
27559,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> outside in the world so like they sent this woman like her husband gets sent out <SP1>
27560,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
27561,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> to like research it and explore it but he like <SP1>
27562,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> he like comes back like really different or something and so they think like it's not him it's actually like a copy of him that the outside world made <SP1>
27563,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> oh <SP2>
27564,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> so like they sent a bunch of like other researchers out or something <SP1>
27565,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> mhm <SP2>

27573,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> i want to watch it <SP1>
27574,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
27575,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> just for the bear that's like the bear in the <SP1>
27576,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> the one that leonardo di caprio was <SP1>

27578,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27579,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i still don't know that's about like i heard he was like <SP2>
27580,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> i f <SP1>
27581,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> doing like extreme stuff to get into the role <SP2>
27582,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> i think he i think he only had <SP1>
27583,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> i think i don't know if this is happened in the movie i think he like killed a bear and to stay warm he crawled inside it <SP1>
27584,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> what the fuck <SP2>
27585,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> wouldn't the bear get like cold though because it's dead <SP2>
27586,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> what it's still furry <SP1>
27587,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i guess <SP2>
27588,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> how do you crawl inside the bear <SP2>
27589,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> i guess he i don't wanna think about it i guess he had to slit it open and like get inside <SP1>
27590,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i guess <SP2>
27591,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> it's also just gross <SP1>
27592,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> who comes up with these plots <SP2>
27593,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah or maybe maybe i just imagined <SP1>
27594,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> like <SP2>
27595,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> i feel like <SP1>
27596,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> like i don't know honestly who comes up with these kinda plots like like man gets trapped in wilderness crawls into bear to stay warm you watch that for two hours <SP2>
27597,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> now i'm wait now i'm like questioning if that actually happens <SP1>
27598,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
27599,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> no that it definitely that movie definitely happened <SP2>
27600,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i also heard like that was like some of the critique c c the critique about gravity like it was just like two straight hours <SP2>
27601,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> oh yeah <SP1>

27622,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> it was like a war film <SP1>
27623,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
27624,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> solidly a war film like <SP1>
27625,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> s but there was like noises from like all the explosions right <SP2>
27626,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah like there was like it was all <SP1>
27627,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> like there was no dialogue you didn't learn the characters names it was all just like about the war <SP1>
27628,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> so o but was like the dialogue implied like like i don't know if like a general like said like oh like here's our orders to like go attack this area like was that implied or is it just like entire movie about a battle <SP2>

27630,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> like i guess there was no speaking in the a in the way there's no dialogue like it wasn't none of the speaking was to like <SP1>
27631,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> move the plot <SP1>
27632,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
27633,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> or like h w was essential to the plot it was like very like realistic like oh yeah like no one in the real life would like have a thirty minute conversation about that like <SP1>
27634,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
27635,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> it would just be like oh like very bare minimum what needs to be said <SP1>
27636,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> oh okay <SP2>
27637,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27638,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> interesting <SP2>
27639,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah i really liked it i also really like harry styles <SP1>
27640,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> he like upgraded <SP2>
27641,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah he really all he had to do was get a hair cut <SP1>
27642,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> that's true <SP2>
27643,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i don't know i i think like whenever watch movies i focus more on like <SP2>
27644,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> like i don't know what i see <SP2>
27645,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27646,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> but like i always miss like intentional like stylistic things <SP2>
27647,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> oh like i mean that's like any art form i f i feel like you need <SP1>
27648,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
27649,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> it needs to be accessible to someone who doesn't have a degree in it <SP1>
27650,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
27651,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i know cause i feel like i've i like fixate more on like the characters <SP2>

27672,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> i feel it that's why it's a cult classic <SP1>
27673,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i know <SP2>
27674,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> cause it's so bad <SP1>
27675,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i know <SP2>
27676,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> like some video on youtube described it like it's like if an alien w like if you showed an alien and explained an al to an alien like what movies are but and like the alien tried to make one without knowing what a movie a without like actually understanding like how movie like is like why movie can be like how a successful movie operates it's just like you explain like oh a movie needs plot like characters it needs some plot it needs like a setting <SP2>
27677,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> it needs like like this this like drama <SP1>
27678,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> that happens here <SP1>
27679,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
27680,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> it's like i don't know i like don't understand like that movie at all <SP2>
27681,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> it's like um <SP1>

27683,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
27684,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> taking the translated part and then putting it on the other side again <SP1>
27685,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> oh my god <SP2>
27686,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> so to translate it again back into the original it's just like not <SP1>
27687,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> yeah like whatever whatever this is is like not like i don't even know <SP2>
27688,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> but i heard like <SP1>
27689,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> i heard like the guy who directed it was like this he had like a weird backstory <SP1>
27690,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> ye no like <SP2>
27691,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> he was like a model <SP1>
27692,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> yeah i i don't know it's like tommy was those like <SP2>
27693,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27694,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> like nobody knows like what we're he's from like <SP2>
27695,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27696,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> exa it's he's just like showed up one day and like <SP2>
27697,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> he had money and to make a movie <SP2>
27698,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> he had money he had a weird accent <SP1>
27699,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> yeah <SP2>
27700,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> that no one really knows where it came from <SP1>
27701,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i know like it's like <SP2>
27702,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> it's like low key shady as hell <SP2>
27703,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah but yeah you know as an actor you probably do need some money <SP1>
27704,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> mm that's true <SP2>
27705,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i won i feel like that those actors the rest of the actors are probably like i can't believe i've like participa y i believe i believe i i can't believe i participated in this <SP2>
27706,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> i can't believe i'm doing this <SP1>
27707,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> r rip my career <SP2>
27708,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27709,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> but they got into it right like they <SP1>
27710,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i don't i mean i feel like <SP2>
27711,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> like they acted seriously <SP1>
27712,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> the other actors weren't even like that good though <SP2>
27713,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah cause they were the people that couldn't get other roles <SP1>
27714,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i don't know it's like like they're not good actors <SP2>
27715,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27716,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> and the fact that they were in the room only made it made like later on worse i guess <SP2>
27717,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> have you seen the disaster artist <SP1>
27718,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> no but it's like <SP2>
27719,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> it's pretty good <SP1>
27720,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> it's so slow to explain the backstory right <SP2>
27721,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> mm yeah it's like based on like <SP1>
27722,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> the guy who is his friend who like co did stuff with him um it's like based on his biography <SP1>
27723,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> oh <SP2>
27724,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27725,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> so i guess like <SP2>
27726,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> cause he like wrote about it <SP1>
27727,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> like so i guess there's like some but i mean obviously like the friend probably like hid a bunch of stuff <SP2>
27728,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27729,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> so i guess like we don't like have the entire truth <SP2>
27730,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27731,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> still doesn't make sense <SP1>
27732,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
27733,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> even if we had the entire truth <SP1>
27734,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> that's true to be fair like a lot of directors make like interesting choices <SP2>
27735,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah yeah <SP1>
27736,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> like michael bay explosions so many <SP2>
27737,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> that's just throwing money at the cgi team <SP1>
27738,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> to be fair though like the explosions do get a lot of attention <SP2>
27739,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> you're saying that cause i know you like movies with lots of explosions <SP1>
27740,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> yeah i would like easily or it you could like easily grab my attention i don't know i i think i just like movies that are like not realistic <SP2>
27741,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> oh <SP1>
27742,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> like i just i like things that are not like set too much in the real world <SP2>
27743,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> mm <SP1>
27744,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> like i like i don't know i like mcu because it's like it's like in the real world but it's like not <SP2>
27745,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> what do you like <SP1>
27746,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> like i i don't know i like i like things c like mcu <SP2>
27747,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> which <SP1>
27748,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> cause <SP2>
27749,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> like the mar <SP2>
27750,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> what's mcu <SP1>
27751,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> the marvel cin the marvel movies <SP2>
27752,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> oh oh yeah <SP1>
27753,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> cause like they're like s you you know they're set in the real world but like obviously there's a lot of like fantasy sci fi elements to it <SP2>
27754,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> mm <SP1>
27755,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> so i guess like u that's why i like it <SP2>
27756,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> mm <SP1>
27757,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> um <SP2>
27758,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i don't know also i guess i just like things about <SP2>
27759,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> that are not like common experiences <SP2>
27760,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> oh yeah like <SP1>
27761,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> like why would i watch a movie about an average person <SP1>
27762,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> kinda thing <SP1>
27763,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> yeah i don't know like to be honest like i can never like g get like too behind um like movies like <SP2>
27764,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i don't know like about like because like i like everyday people <SP2>
27765,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
27766,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i don't know like i don't i don't really like high school movies cause it's kind of like this is it's like it's not realistic but it's it's but like it's supposed to be realistic so it's like i don't know like how to feel <SP2>
27767,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> oh i think like i enj enjoy like mean girls <SP1>
27768,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
27769,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> cause what they do is like they take kind of real things and they just exaggerate it <SP1>
27770,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i know <SP2>
27771,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> out of proportion <SP1>
27772,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> so it's like more real i don't <SP1>
27773,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> but i guess like those movies probably make more s like are more like realistic <SP2>
27774,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> mhm <SP1>
27775,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> if you like went to high school in like the early two thousand through the nineties <SP2>
27776,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27777,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> cause the culture has like definitely changed like in like the way bullying is portrayed it's not like oh we're gonna <SP2>
27778,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> oh it's like online <SP1>
27779,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> yeah it's not like we're gonna like i don't know steal your lunch money <SP2>
27780,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> anymore it's like <SP2>
27781,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah the <SP1>
27782,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> it's like oh we're gonna like say things about you and like keep posting like things about you <SP2>
27783,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> have you seen to all the boys i've loved before or something <SP1>
27784,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> no but i heard it was really good <SP2>
27785,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> wait you haven't seen it <SP1>
27786,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> no <SP2>
27787,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> you should definitely watch it like first of all like asian lead <SP1>
27788,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> great and then also like yeah i mean they portray high school kind of weird but it's like enjoyable because it's not real <SP1>
27789,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> mhm <SP2>
27790,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> yeah <SP1>
27791,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> i think pr the main issues just cause the actors are so old they're not actual teenagers <SP2>
27792,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> oh yeah <SP1>
27793,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> so they like <SP2>
27794,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> so like when you see a like a high school movie it's always like like the actors are already like what twenty or something <SP2>
27795,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP1> i'm like no high school junior or senior looked this attractive <SP1>
27796,2018-10-20-session-3_nogaps_step1_GPT,36,<SP2> you <SP2>
