- Progress:
    1. Working on the inference POC notebook for the original GPT code â†’
        Completed 3.0-MU-GPT-SurprisalInference-POC.ipynb notebook.
    2. Creating 4.0-MU-GPT-ICC-preprocess-POC.ipynb notebook for POC of the ICC
        data preprocessing required for the final experiment.

- Progress:
    1. Generating train / val / test data from ICC POC notebook.
        - This was done without problems.
    2. Testing GPT finetune POC notebook using the ICC data.
        - This was done with no issues and training started.
    2. Converting notebooks to scripts and running on the HPC.
        - Created script for finetuning GPT and the associated configuration file.
        - Submitted a batch job to the cluster and waiting for results

- Progress:
    1. Attempting to fix CUDA runtime errors.
        - Fixed this by using the following configuration:
            - torch == 10.1
            - python=3.8
            - Cuda version = cuda/10.2
    2. Attempting to fix Cuda out of memory error on the first training epoch.
        - Need to experiment with the size of the loaded Dataset.
            - Probably the easiest solution is to just use TextDataset.


DATE: 6/22/22
- Progress:
    1. Attempting to resolve the CUDA memory error issue
        - doing different tests in the POC notebook.
